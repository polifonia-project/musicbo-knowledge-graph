MusicBO;1;1009;The more I deviated from the path which my wife regarded as the only profitable one, due partly to the change of my views (which I grew ever less willing to communicate to her), and partly to the modification in my attitude towards the stage, the more my wife retreated from that position of close fellowship with me which my wife had enjoyed in former years, and which my wife thought herself justified in connecting in some way with my successes.
MusicBO;1;154;We spent an evening together at Schumann's, had a little music, and finally began a discussion on Mendelssohn and Meyerbeer, in which Liszt and Schumann differed so fundamentally that the latter, completely losing his temper, retired in a fury to his bedroom for quite a long time.
MusicBO;1;548;In this business I noticed the very pronounced activity of a former college friend, Marschall von Bieberstein, a lawyer who, in his capacity as senior officer of the Dresden Communal Guard, distinguished himself by his boundless zeal amid the shouts of a mighty band of fellow-orators.
MusicBO;1;722;In Freiberg I had met four hundred reservists, who had come in excellent form to back the citizen army, but could not proceed further, as four hundred reservists, who had come in excellent form to back the citizen army were tired out by their forced march.
MusicBO;1;516;Simultaneously with this, came the intelligence of the national uprising in Wurtemberg, where the troops themselves had frustrated the intentions of the government by their declaration of fidelity to the parliament, and the ministry had been compelled against their will to acknowledge the Pan-German Constitution.
MusicBO;1;1042;Consequently Alfred Escher rose very rapidly to high positions in the government, to which Alfred Escher rendered valuable and important services, first as Minister of Finance, a post Alfred Escher held for many years, and later with particular distinction as member of the School Federation.
MusicBO;1;147;What determined this feeling even more than the insults I had suffered, was the recognition of the fact that I was now utterly incapable of ever being able to enlist his influence in the cause of theatrical reform, which was so dear to me.
MusicBO;1;875;Here in rural seclusion I spent three days, entertainment of a peculiar nature being provided by the meeting of a popular assembly, which consisted of the remainder of the contingent of revolutionaries which had marched off towards Dresden and had now returned in disorder.
MusicBO;1;1088;I now received a direct reply, which, in addition to the fact that it testified to the vigour and activity with which Schroder-Devrient had fought her difficulties, at the same time showed me that Schroder-Devrient earnestly desired to be reunited with me.
MusicBO;1;1170;These were the first signs of that new phase in my life upon which I entered from this day forth, and in which I accustomed myself to look upon the outward circumstances of my existence as being merely subservient to my will.
MusicBO;1;1059;Soon after I had settled in Zurich I began to write down my various ideas about things at which I had arrived through my private and artistic experiences, as well as through the influence of the political unrest of the day.
MusicBO;1;13;I remembered that I had seen him once before not long after the first performance of Tannhauser, when he asked me for my autograph for a copy of the score of that opera, which was on sale at the music-shop.
MusicBO;1;114;I observed in him a certain wildness and vehemence, the impression of which returned to me very vividly some months later, when I heard of his being shot as a rebel who had participated in the October Insurrection at Vienna.
MusicBO;1;855;After being stirred up to a certain pitch of excitement his mood became positively alarming, and he almost gnashed his teeth in a passion of fury directed against a certain section of society which had also aroused my deepest indignation.
MusicBO;1;121;"He seemed quite disposed to listen in a friendly manner to what I had to say to him; he did not, however, attempt to conceal his surprise at my direct appeals and the personal demands I made of him."
MusicBO;1;128;On the homeward journey I touched at Prague, where I found my old friend Kittl (who had grown very much more corpulent) still in the most terrible fright about the riotous events which had taken place there.
MusicBO;1;1153;I thought this all the more reason why Wigand the publisher should accept my new revolutionary book, and expected him to pay me a fee which would be in proportion to the greater size of the work.
MusicBO;1;273;I regarded this turn of events with no little satisfaction, believing that in the study of this particular work I should find a wholesome and effective diversion from all the excitement and confusion of recent events.
MusicBO;1;427;The winter of this year, up to the spring of 1849, passed in a manysided development of my position and temper, as I have described them, that is to say, in a sort of dull agitation.
MusicBO;1;904;I had braced myself to meet the crucial moment early the next morning, when the policeman came into my room and, not knowing to whom the passports belonged, gave me three at random to choose from.
MusicBO;1;1017;And then I found myself confronted by such hardness in the woman whom I had spoilt by my leniency, that it was out of the question to expect her to acknowledge the injustice done to myself.
MusicBO;1;1179;"As the result of this treatment and the irritating effect this treatment had upon my nerves, I lost my voice completely for a while; whereupon I was told that I must go away for a change."
MusicBO;1;1276;Without clearly realising what it would lead to, and without coming to any understanding with her, I left Bordeaux towards the end of April, more excited than soothed in spirit, and filled with regret and anxiety.
MusicBO;1;165;This was too flagrant a misdeed for the public prosecutors: Rockel was therefore immediately placed under arrest, and had to remain three days in gaol while an action for high treason was lodged against him.
MusicBO;1;511;In those circumstances the town council saw the town council were no longer able to face the situation, and thereupon took part in summoning those members of the Saxon Chamber who were still in Dresden.
MusicBO;1;662;Up to this moment I had been moved only by a feeling of sympathy for a method of procedure entered upon at first with almost ironical incredulity, and then pursued with the vigour of surprise.
MusicBO;1;816;At five o'clock the next morning I got up (after a few hours' sleep) and set out to find my brother-in-law Wolfram's house, which was about a quarter of an hour's walk from the town.
MusicBO;1;928;The idea did not please me, and I found sufficient excuse for warding off the negotiations by saying I was afraid of the epidemic of cholera which was said to be raging in the city.
MusicBO;1;1231;It turned out that my answer prompted her to send me a kind and pressing invitation to go and stay at her house, at least for a short time, to rest and forget my troubles.
MusicBO;1;67;I must own, however, that I felt bound to urge this king to assume a much more familiar attitude towards his people than the court atmosphere and the almost exclusive society of his nobles
MusicBO;1;242;When a musician appeared before the public decorated with the wonderful order, a musician was greeted with great jubilation by the loyal audience that filled the theatre on the evening of the festival concert.
MusicBO;1;406;This a man gladly did, not only for the sake of necessary bodily exercise, but also because a man could do so in this part of the world without fear of meeting his pursuers.
MusicBO;1;307;He induced me to come to a meeting of this union of the orchestral company, in order that I might form an opinion about it, and encourage and support so praiseworthy a movement.
MusicBO;1;496;As I approached the scene of operations through the Rampische Gasse, I met a company of the Dresden Communal Guards, who, although they were quite innocent, had apparently been exposed to this fire.
MusicBO;1;993;With this money I made up my mind to leave for Zurich and ask Alex Muller to give me shelter for a while, as his house was sufficiently large to accommodate a guest.
MusicBO;1;1058;I was often frightened at the excessive outbursts of exaltation to which I was prone—no matter whom I was with—and which led me to indulge in the most extraordinary paradoxes in my conversation.
MusicBO;1;1218;In response to this invitation I wrote a long essay on Kunst und Klima ('Art and Climate'), in which I supplemented the ideas I had already touched upon in my Kunstwerk der Zukunft.
MusicBO;1;1303;I looked over my Lohengrin score, and quickly decided to send my Lohengrin score to Liszt and leave my Lohengrin score to him to bring my Lohengrin score out as best Liszt could.
MusicBO;1;1320;Impressing upon him the necessity for the strictest secrecy, I invited him to join me at the Lake of Geneva, and in the second week in May we met at the Hotel Byron.
MusicBO;1;194;It was of the highest importance to me to secure an organisation of the theatre, which would make the carrying out its loftiest ideals not only a possibility but also a certainty.
MusicBO;1;399;For supper my wife set before him finely cut slices of sausage and meat, which a man at once devoured wholesale, instead of spreading them frugally on his bread in Saxon fashion.
MusicBO;1;1198;In view of the tidings which continually arrived concerning the cruelty and brutality with which the soldiers treated the prisoners, we could not help considering our own lot a very happy one.
MusicBO;1;1373;I had only met her once before in Dresden, when Karl had invited me to be present at the performance of a quartette of his own composition, given at his mother's house.
MusicBO;1;537;The next day (Friday the 5th of May), when I again took my place as a passionately interested spectator of the proceedings at the Town Hall, events took a decisive turn.
MusicBO;1;795;I therefore went to the Town Hall, where I found the townspeople entertaining to the best of their ability a blustering horde of excited revolutionaries both within and without the walls.
MusicBO;1;888;I started accordingly on my walk of about six hours, and came over the plateau into the little university town (which now received me hospitably for the first time) at sunset.
MusicBO;1;910;I had been the more willing to accept my friends' suggestion to take the Swiss route to Paris, as I knew I should find an old acquaintance, Alexander Muller, at Zurich.
MusicBO;1;1029;I soon gave up the large room containing a grand piano, which Alex Muller had allotted to me on the impulse of the moment, and retired to a modest little bedroom.
MusicBO;1;1280;I was filled with distress and anger at being called upon to waste my energies in a direction contrary to my tastes, merely to satisfy the unreasonable demands made upon me.
MusicBO;1;155;This incident did indeed place us in a somewhat awkward position towards our host, but This incident furnished us with a most amusing topic of conversation on the way home
MusicBO;1;393;I had just then been inspired by a study of the Gospels to conceive the plan of a tragedy for the ideal stage of the future, entitled Jesus of Nazareth.
MusicBO;1;407;My attempts during our conversations to instruct him more fully regarding my artistic aims remained quite unavailing as long as we were unable to quit the field of mere discussion.
MusicBO;1;573;The truce expired at noon, and the troops, supported by several guns, at once opened the attack on one, of the principal positions held by the people on the Neumarkt.
MusicBO;1;621;In a few moments the Opera House (which as regards size was, it is true, an imposing edifice), together with its highly inflammable contents, was a vast sea of flames.
MusicBO;1;175;Moreover, it was necessary to warn him that if the reactionary party should ever come into power again, the reactionary party could never possibly forgive him for this newspaper.
MusicBO;1;504;I recollect quite clearly that from that moment I was attracted by surprise and interest in the drama, without feeling any desire to join the ranks of the combatants.
MusicBO;1;562;"Every one was in a high state of glee about the revolution; they all heartily approved of the barricades, and felt no scruples about desiring victory for their defenders."
MusicBO;1;630;As a matter of fact, I had heard a rumour that Rockel had arrived on this very day, but as yet I had not obtained a glimpse of him.
MusicBO;1;945;this apparition recalled so many things affecting myself which reflected suspicion on the man, in particular the significance of his behaviour towards me in Berlin on the last occasion.
MusicBO;1;65;My special aim was to turn the attention of the few who really took the matter seriously, from the external form of the government to its intrinsic value.
MusicBO;1;490;I heard afterwards that a charge of high treason on account of sedition had been brought against Schroder-Devrient by reason of her conduct in regard to this matter.
MusicBO;1;547;The rest of the day passed in continuous negotiations over the truce which, by arrangement with the Saxon troops, was to last until noon of the next day.
MusicBO;1;553;"Everybody was afraid to take this course; on the other hand, great expectations were entertained from negotiations with the Frankfort States Assembly, which was on its last legs."
MusicBO;1;823;On being asked for their names Heubner had announced himself in a tone of authority, and had bidden the town councillors come to him at a certain hotel.
MusicBO;1;915;These two people, who had been joined by a few intimates, received me with such respectful curiosity and sympathy that I felt at home with them at once.
MusicBO;1;1121;Thus for a while I enjoyed comparative peace, although in my heart a spirit of unrest had begun to reign, thanks to my growing acquaintance with Feuerbach's works.
MusicBO;1;91;I travelled by way of Breslau, where I looked up an old friend of my family, the musical director Mosewius, at whose house I spent an evening.
MusicBO;1;141;He also informed me that he had not only reprimanded them very severely, but that he had also been at great pains to pacify them concerning me.
MusicBO;1;533;Rietschel, who seemed to think I was better informed of the facts than he was, assured me that he felt his position was a very difficult one.
MusicBO;1;959;He too thought I must be counting on making a hit in Paris, and was sure that I had a very good chance of doing so. '
MusicBO;1;73;The astounded audience seemed to remember nothing of the speech of the Orchestral Conductor Royal save the incidental attack I had made upon the court sycophants.
MusicBO;1;244;This was all the more strange as I was quite unaccustomed to such coolness in regard to my work on the part of the Dresden public.
MusicBO;1;253;Except for those who were best informed as to the course of events—and who certainly did not swarm in our streets—these occurrences aroused great uneasiness everywhere.
MusicBO;1;500;Driven by a mechanical impulse I followed the stream of people, which moved once more in the direction of the Town Hall in the Old Market-place.
MusicBO;1;691;Nothing, however, that I have lived through can be compared with the impression that I received on my entry into the chambers of the Town Hall.
MusicBO;1;711;But as the latter had also got large reinforcements, large reinforcements again had been able to make an effective combined attack on the strong Wildstruf barricade.
MusicBO;1;899;I passed the night in a state of strange, feverish excitement, which lasted until the departure of the steamer on Lake Constance early in the morning.
MusicBO;1;907;"It was a lovely spring morning; across the broad lake I could gaze at the Alpine landscape as the Alpine landscape spread itself before my eyes."
MusicBO;1;291;This and other matters of a similar nature brought me into intimate contact with Eduard Devrient, and made our intercourse much more lively and pleasant.
MusicBO;1;433;Now that the powers of reaction were everywhere more and more openly bracing themselves for conflict, the final decisive struggle seemed indeed close at hand.
MusicBO;1;687;A truly terrible spectacle met my eyes, for I crossed those parts of the town in which preparations had been made for a house-to-house fight.
MusicBO;1;951;such a brilliant article about you is incredible that you should not seek to make any profit out of such a brilliant article about you.'
MusicBO;1;21;This well-informed and talkative young man showed his warm and hearty devotion to me more openly, and I felt bound to reciprocate his affection.
MusicBO;1;100;I made another interesting acquaintance in the person of Herr von Fonton, the Russian state councillor, and attache at the Russian Embassy in Vienna.
MusicBO;1;832;This last terrible experience made such an impression on me that I was incapable of breathing a word in connection with what had happened.
MusicBO;1;1289;I felt so upset by all this that I yielded to my craving for retirement, and sought it at no great distance from Paris.
MusicBO;1;1389;Unfortunately I again found myself reduced to a state of extreme nervous fatigue, in which the slightest effort produced a profuse and weakening perspiration.
MusicBO;1;1419;To all this I said not a word, but finally with a smile asked him whether he would like to go over to Zurich?
MusicBO;1;115;For the present, then, I had to satisfy myself with having read the plan of my theatre reform to a few attentive listeners.
MusicBO;1;591;I was itching to climb the Kreuz tower again, so as to get the widest possible survey over the whole field of action.
MusicBO;1;603;A sacred calm and peacefulness lay over the town and the wide suburbs of Dresden, which were visible from my point of vantage.
MusicBO;1;911;I hoped with his help to obtain a passport to France, as I was anxious not to arrive there as a political refugee.
MusicBO;1;1330;The situation was clear enough, and I decided to go to Bordeaux immediately in order to come to an understanding with my opponent
MusicBO;1;1339;I took leave of Karl the same day, in order to set out next morning from Geneva on my tedious journey across France.
MusicBO;1;7;My wife was quite frightened when My wife saw me come back late at night, tired out and very hoarse from shouting.
MusicBO;1;189;In reference to this, I immediately turned my thoughts to what was close at hand, and directed my attention to the theatre.
MusicBO;1;241;had, owing to his conspicuous loyalty at this critical time, especially to me, found exceptional favour in the eyes of our committees.
MusicBO;1;708;Bakinin then gave me a short and precise account of what had happened since I had left him on the previous morning.
MusicBO;1;810;I therefore went back to the coach, which, however, was still putting off its departure, as the road was blocked with troops.
MusicBO;1;876;I listened with curious feelings, amounting almost to contempt, to the speeches on this occasion, which were of every kind and description.
MusicBO;1;1204;Notwithstanding, Semper remained as of old a good, obliging, true-hearted fellow, and even Semper could not help putting up with him cheerfully.
MusicBO;1;1369;His mother also announced her intention of coming to visit us in Villeneuve with her daughter Emilie in a few days' time.
MusicBO;1;16;It was with a strange, and in its way quite a new, sensation that I bade farewell to this young lady.
MusicBO;1;38;The first was called the Deutscher Verein (German Union), whose programme aimed at 'a constitutional monarchy on the broadest democratic foundation.'
MusicBO;1;92;We had a most lively conversation, but, unfortunately, were unable to steer clear of the stirring political questions of the day.
MusicBO;1;174;The only drawback was that the price of the little weekly paper was too small to yield him a corresponding profit.
MusicBO;1;431;On the other hand, the whole political situation, both in Saxony and the rest of Germany, tended inevitably towards a catastrophe.
MusicBO;1;512;These latter now assembled in the Town Hall to decide what steps should be taken for the protection of the state.
MusicBO;1;619;From this I concluded that reasons of this kind act as far more powerful motives in the world than aesthetic considerations.
MusicBO;1;1164;I had written home for help, and had appealed to all the old friends I could think of, but in vain.
MusicBO;1;1255;The emotion aroused in me by finding such an exceptionally developed talent suddenly changed to anxiety when I heard her sing.
MusicBO;1;1385;There, at the foot of the colossal and beautiful Matterhorn, we could indeed consider ourselves cut off from the outer world.
MusicBO;1;434;My feelings of partisanship were not sufficiently passionate to make me desire to take any active share in these conflicts.
MusicBO;1;982;During the period when all news from Germany ceased I tried to occupy myself as far as possible with reading.
MusicBO;1;1096;I did my utmost to give her confidence and to make her believe that our present misfortunes were but momentary.
MusicBO;1;1149;It must have been this which Sulzer had in his mind when he spoke deprecatingly of Feuerbach's influence over me.
MusicBO;1;1221;The thought of returning to Zurich was as distasteful to me as the prospect of remaining any longer in Paris.
MusicBO;1;1357;I also added that our friendship could certainly not continue until Jessie had released herself from so humiliating a position.
MusicBO;1;116;All seemed to be convinced that the time was not opportune for putting forward such peaceable schemes of reform.
MusicBO;1;227;Later on I published this fairly extensive essay with the title of Die Nibelungen, but in working it out
MusicBO;1;386;We ought to imagine the whole of Europe with St. Petersburg, Paris, and London transformed into a vast rubbish-heap.
MusicBO;1;387;How could we expect the kindlers of such a fire to retain any consciousness after so vast a devastation?
MusicBO;1;398;As his life of permanent concealment was very dull, I occasionally invited him to spend an evening with me.
MusicBO;1;488;I met her on another occasion at the house of my old friend Heine, where Schroder-Devrient had taken refuge.
MusicBO;1;854;I thus had occasion to take alarm at a trait in his character which was entirely new to me.
MusicBO;1;930;Through this street funeral processions, announced by the muffled drum boats of the National Guard, passed practically every hour.
MusicBO;1;1138;It seemed right that the only true immortality should be that of sublime deeds and great works of art.
MusicBO;1;1202;Semper made at this time quite a good pastel portrait of me in his very best and earliest style.
MusicBO;1;1224;—I saw this work of Meyerbeer's break upon the world like the dawn heralding this day of disgraceful desolation.
MusicBO;1;1277;I returned to Paris, for the time being, stunned and full of uncertainty as to what to do next.
MusicBO;1;1340;But I was so exhausted by all this that I could not help thinking I was going to die.
MusicBO;1;36;This I sent to the Oesterreichischen Zeitung, where it was printed in their columns with my full signature.
MusicBO;1;401;I was similarly astonished at the manner in which a man drank wine from our ordinary-sized small glasses.
MusicBO;1;518;Everything seemed to depend on making the Saxon battalions in Dresden understand the paramount importance of their action.
MusicBO;1;565;Baden and the Palatinate were in the throes of a revolt on behalf of the whole of Germany.
MusicBO;1;569;Vigorous promises of support came from the Saxon Erzgebirge, as well as announcements that armed contingents were forthcoming.
MusicBO;1;590;For the rest of the day the battle confined itself to skirmishes by sharpshooters from the various positions.
MusicBO;1;771;Tell me frankly, so that I may know if I can rely on your friendship in the future?'
MusicBO;1;866;And in fact the news from Dresden, when we returned to Weimar the next day, was serious indeed.
MusicBO;1;975;We were soon joined by another refugee, young Heine, who had once wished to paint my Lohengrin scenery.
MusicBO;1;994;My saddest moment came when, after a long silence, I at last received a letter from my wife.
MusicBO;1;1020;After I had got over the first shock of her heartless behaviour, I was absolutely clear about this.
MusicBO;1;1111;But it was soon time to think of how to earn enough money to provide for us all.
MusicBO;1;1366;At last I arrived at Geneva, and returned to the Byron hotel, where Karl Hitter was awaiting me.
MusicBO;1;1374;On this occasion the respect and devotion shown me by each member of the family had delighted me.
MusicBO;1;342;It was long before this date that I first made the acquaintance of this most remarkable man.
MusicBO;1;378;Democracy, republicanism, and anything else of the kind a la Proudhon regarded as unworthy of serious consideration.
MusicBO;1;515;A general outcry immediately arose for measures to be adopted to prevent this incursion of foreign troops.
MusicBO;1;560;At home I found my two nieces, Clara and Ottilie Brockhaus, the daughters of my sister Louisa.
MusicBO;1;824;the town councillors had no sooner reached the hotel than they all three collapsed from excessive fatigue.
MusicBO;1;929;I was staying in the Rue Notre Dame de Lorette for the sake of being near Belloni.
MusicBO;1;968;We met again with no little pleasure, although we could not help smiling at our grotesque situation.
MusicBO;1;1004;Our youthful days of worry and care in Paris had undoubtedly been of benefit to us both.
MusicBO;1;1014;Unfortunately, and to my intense grief, I was forced to recognise that by acting in this way
MusicBO;1;1171;And by this means I was able to escape from the hampering narrowness of my home life.
MusicBO;1;1196;He had left his family in Dresden, from which town we soon received the most alarming news.
MusicBO;1;1297;This seemed a hint from Fate, and I felt I must seek shelter here at all costs.
MusicBO;1;1305;I even invited Kietz to come and stay with me and share the pleasures of my retreat.
MusicBO;1;190;The motive for this came not only from my own feelings, but also from external circumstances.
MusicBO;1;213;and then I gave up, not only all my exertions, but all my hopes as well.
MusicBO;1;343;For years I had come across his name in the newspapers, and always under extraordinary circumstances.
MusicBO;1;449;For this purpose I obtained leave of absence from my management for the second week in
MusicBO;1;472;The clang of this bell, so close at hand, made a profound impression upon me also.
MusicBO;1;528;The Old Town of Dresden, with its barricades, was an interesting enough sight for the spectators.
MusicBO;1;612;A change seemed to have been made in the plan of attack by the Prussian troops.
MusicBO;1;826;I heard further that the police had been removed to Altenburg under a strong military escort.
MusicBO;1;902;should I have to converse with them in accordance with the abovementioned irregularities in that document.
MusicBO;1;936;The only person there to give me a friendly welcome was the old clerk, Monsieur Henri.
MusicBO;1;998;Often during the recent extraordinary events I had even believed that my wife understood my feelings.
MusicBO;1;1316;from whence I travelled on to Geneva, there to await news from Frau Ritter in Dresden.
MusicBO;1;1424;Without breathing another syllable about all that had happened, we left the next day for Zurich.
MusicBO;1;1;This was the last of the newly inaugurated concerts that I ever conducted in Dresden.
MusicBO;1;354;Everything about him was colossal, and Balumin was full of a primitive exuberance and strength.
MusicBO;1;452;This event imposed upon me the friendly task of caring for Rockel and his family.
MusicBO;1;478;I only found his wife at home, as he was away on a holiday tour.
MusicBO;1;601;Sunday (the 7th of May) was one of the most beautiful days in the year.
MusicBO;1;606;It was impossible not to feel deeply impressed at the sight of this continuous procession.
MusicBO;1;686;At last I reached the Town Hall in the Altstadt, just as night was falling.
MusicBO;1;864;I was filled with strange musings as to my fate when I visited this castle.
MusicBO;1;912;I had been on very friendly terms with Muller once upon a time at Wurzburg.
MusicBO;1;956;Whereupon I assured him that I was not thinking of writing any scores at all.
MusicBO;1;1093;I must honestly confess that the little dog and the bird made me very happy.
MusicBO;1;275;I did not make any remark, nor ask the reason for this singular behaviour.
MusicBO;1;372;This annihilation of all civilisation was the goal upon which his heart was set.
MusicBO;1;463;One of the chief subjects under debate was the necessity of preparing for defence.
MusicBO;1;539;Professor Kochly, who was an eloquent speaker, was chosen to proclaim the new administration.
MusicBO;1;580;He was able to give me an extraordinarily accurate account of what had happened.
MusicBO;1;661;I must confess that this idea seemed to me magnificent and full of meaning.
MusicBO;1;840;Meanwhile, alarming news of the terrible conditions in Dresden continued to pour into Weimar.
MusicBO;1;898;At the gates I, together with the other passengers, was asked for my passport.
MusicBO;1;1371;Both ladies arrived in time to celebrate my thirtyseventh birthday on the twenty-second of
MusicBO;1;122;He was the first playwright I had ever seen in an official uniform.
MusicBO;1;426;This was shortly to be proved in the momentous insurrection of May, 1849.
MusicBO;1;462;On every side I heard a medley of wild proposals and hesitating responses.
MusicBO;1;475;My most pronounced sensation beyond this was one of great, almost extravagant, satisfaction.
MusicBO;1;526;Of course no one took any notice of these placards except intending informers.
MusicBO;1;1015;I lost all my power over her affections, and especially over her character.
MusicBO;1;1144;But what had really induced me to attach so much importance to Feuerbach
MusicBO;1;1146;secondly, that only that was real which could be ascertained by the senses.
MusicBO;1;1298;An extraordinarily small and narrow bedroom was shown me, which I immediately engaged.
MusicBO;1;1346;It was nine o'clock in the morning when I sent him this message.
MusicBO;1;320;We had at last to part with mutual shruggings of the shoulder.
MusicBO;1;554;Everything was to be done as far as possible in legal form.
MusicBO;1;1128;As an introduction to philosophy I now chose Hegel's Philosophy of History.
MusicBO;1;1215;It is true, the result of my writings was hardly less discouraging.
MusicBO;1;1263;The fact that Laussot had for some time been well aware of
MusicBO;1;1323;I was enjoying in preparing my poem of Siegfried's Tod for publication.
MusicBO;1;1348;, I received a summons from the police-station to present myself immediately.
MusicBO;1;111;later on I was to have no reason to be proud.
MusicBO;1;695;These tall men, at other times an object of considerable fear
MusicBO;1;701;I found Bakunin's outlook undisturbed, and his attitude firm and quiet.
MusicBO;1;725;My old friend Marschall von Bieberstein immediately proposed to accompany me.
MusicBO;1;839;I found it impossible to come to any conclusion about it.
MusicBO;1;897;From there I continued my journey by mail-coach straight to Lindau.
MusicBO;1;953;But what do you expect to get out of the revolution?'
MusicBO;1;1377;His mother and her daughter remained with us about a week.
MusicBO;1;1423;I can see no sense in anything either here or there.'
MusicBO;2;476;I now learned for the first time what the prevalent opinion was about these much-maligned occurrences in Germany, and I was in a position to defend my poor friend Rockel, who had been branded as a coward, and to put not only his conduct but also my own in a different light to that in which it had been regarded hitherto even by Hermann Franck, who afterwards expressed his sincere regret that he had so misunderstood us.
MusicBO;2;727;I felt that before entering on such a gigantic task as the music to my drama of the Nibelungen, I must positively make one final effort to see whether I could not, in some new environment, attain an existence more in harmony with my feelings than I could possibly aspire to after so many compromises.
MusicBO;2;1055;As Sainton was at the head of the same orchestra which was at my disposal for the Philharmonic concerts, Sainton was able to foster an attitude of hostility to the undertakings for which I was responsible, and even my friend Sainton had to suffer from his animosity without actually realising the source of the annoyance.
MusicBO;2;2743;Our contract stipulated that for each of these three operas he was to pay me a sum of one thousand francs down, and further payments on their being performed in a Paris theatre, namely, one thousand francs after the first ten performances, and the same amount for the following performances up to the twentieth.
MusicBO;2;4075;To enter the old familiar hall of the Gewandhaus at Leipzig was enough in itself to cause me an uneasy feeling of depression, which was increased by my reception by the members of the orchestra—of whose estrangement I was keenly conscious—and to whom I had to introduce myself as an entire stranger.
MusicBO;2;1027;Unfortunately, my friends put down my protests to my sense of humour, and were not in the least spurred to exert themselves, with the result that I had to be very stern and almost rude the following winter, to deter them, once and for all, from making further demands upon me.
MusicBO;2;575;But even from this more important and grander expedition, and almost the only one I had ever undertaken purely for recreation, I returned with a strangely unsatisfied feeling, and I could not resist the longing for something decisive in the distance, that would give a fresh direction to my life.
MusicBO;2;1556;"During the months of January and February (1857) I completed the first act of Siegfried, writing down the composition in full to take the place of the earlier rough pencil draft, and immediately set to work on the orchestration; but I probably carried out Vaillant's instructions with too much zeal."
MusicBO;2;4322;he and several other musicians of the Imperial orchestra were all Germans, and on our arrival at the St. Petersburg railway station he and several other musicians of the Imperial orchestra joyfully introduced me to a further large contingent from the orchestra, headed by the committee of the Philharmonic Society.
MusicBO;2;1013;I did not quite know what to do, as, from a business point of view, it was of no advantage to me, and, as far as the conducting went, it was not much in my line, unless I could rely on at least a few high-class artistic productions.
MusicBO;2;2158;"At that time I had a particular affection for Stuttgart, owing to the reasons I have already mentioned; this was also true of Vienna, which had been the first place to produce Lohengrin, and, in consequence of its success, thought The Stuttgart Court Theatre necessary to secure Tannhauser."
MusicBO;2;1624;In the worst of tempers we spent a week in the inn, and I began to wonder whether it was worth while occupying this new piece of land at all, for I had a sudden foreboding that it would be my fate to wander further afield.
MusicBO;2;261;This clear and exhaustive treatise appeared to me admirably adapted to form the basis for a new theory of the higher art of musical phrasing, whereby Beethoven's most obscure construction might be explained, and elaborated into a comprehensible system that would allow of further application.
MusicBO;2;877;With regard to my own case, This young man (who had been born since the early days of my friendship with his father) stated that it could be easily remedied if we ascertained by careful experiments what metallic substance would specifically influence my nervous system.
MusicBO;2;2565;"I had only met her once before; this was during my visit to London in 1855, when Minna had made herself known to me by a letter in which Minna enthusiastically expressed her agreement with the opinions contained in my book Das Kunstwerk der Zukunft."
MusicBO;2;402;I began to breathe freely at last, because I had always felt that it was merely self-deception on my part to maintain that it would be possible to produce Junger Siegfried with the limited means at the disposal of even the best German theatre.
MusicBO;2;1665;With regard to the Nibelungen dramas, I was compelled to adhere without flinching to the one essential stipulation that it could only be produced under quite exceptional conditions, such as those I afterwards described in the preface to the printed edition of the poem.
MusicBO;2;2302;I enjoyed the curious charm of protecting myself against the extremes of the sun's heat by carefully keeping my room cool and dark, and going out on to my balcony only in the evening to surrender myself to the influence of the summer air.
MusicBO;2;4331;With me, on the contrary, Seroff entered into the most intimate understanding, as Seroff had so perfect an appreciation of me and my art that our intercourse became almost one of mere pleasantry, for on all serious points we were in entire agreement.
MusicBO;2;883;As far as the technique was concerned, I soon found myself in a difficulty when I started to write down the orchestral overture, conceived in Spezia in a kind of half-dream, in my usual way of sketching it out on two lines.
MusicBO;2;3009;I addressed an express request to this effect to the cabinet minister Walewsky, but received the answer that it was impossible to comply with my wishes, more particularly on account of the heavy expenses which had already been incurred in its preparation.
MusicBO;2;3548;Of this I made no secret in my occasional communications to the Wesendoncks, who, apparently to cheer me up, invited me to meet them in Venice, where the Wesendoncks, who, apparently to cheer me up were just going for a pleasure trip.
MusicBO;2;4782;Herr Pfistermeister informed me at the same time that Herr Pfistermeister was instructed to conduct me to Munich at once to see the King, and begged my permission to inform his master by telegram that I would come on the following day.
MusicBO;2;540;The next morning the visit to the islands themselves delighted me so much that I could not understand how I had managed to come upon anything so charming, and wondered what would result from the visit to the islands themselves.
MusicBO;2;37;, I was glad to be able to suggest a little change for him, and persuade him to go for a holiday to Weimar, where the first performance of Lohengrin was to take place about the end of August.
MusicBO;2;118;The sojourn of my young friends at St. Gall had been pleasantly varied during the previous winter by a visit to Zurich, when Hans made his appearance as pianist at one of the concerts of the musical society there.
MusicBO;2;914;"I purposely kept the fact of my sudden flight from them; I had my own reasons for doing so, and as even my young friends were rather interesting from a psychological point of view, I have never forgotten them."
MusicBO;2;956;At first I naturally found his ideas by no means palatable, and felt I could not readily abandon that so-called 'cheerful' Greek aspect of the world, with which I had looked out upon life in my Kunstwerk der Zukunft.
MusicBO;2;1918;, I gathered from what he said that he was also anxious about my Nibelungen work, in which he declared he had always taken the liveliest interest, and wanted my assurance that this composition would be produced at Weimar.
MusicBO;2;2360;At last I discovered in the Rue Newton near the Barriere de l'Etoile, a side street off the Champs Elysees, not yet completed in accordance with a former plan of Paris, a nice little villa with a small garden.
MusicBO;2;3591;With unconcealed joy I most gratefully accepted this kind invitation, and my only care now was so to arrange my affairs that I could take my departure from Vienna and effect my removal to Paris in a proper manner.
MusicBO;2;3593;But as I was only to get one thousand marks, and even this was to be subject to so many clauses and conditions as to suggest a desire to renounce the whole transaction, I at once rejected the offer.
MusicBO;2;3923;As we were deliberating about the field of activity on which he ought now to enter, I advised him to seek some useful employment in the service of a benevolent and liberal-minded man like the Grand Duke of Baden.
MusicBO;2;4374;It was also thought advisable to introduce me to the commercial circles of St. Petersburg, with a view to my coming benefit concert, and a visit was consequently arranged to a concert in the hall of the Merchants' Guild.
MusicBO;2;381;I led this life for nine weeks, but I was determined not to give in until I felt that every kind of drug or poison I had ever absorbed into my system had been brought to the surface.
MusicBO;2;1249;I hired a boat, and took an hour's row across the lake to visit a young doctor of my acquaintance named Obrist, who had, I knew, come into possession of a village apothecary's stock, which included various poisons.
MusicBO;2;2485;On the other hand, I cannot but bear the highest testimony in favour of the Swabian Therese, who from this time forward performed the entire service of the household alone during the whole of my sojourn in Paris.
MusicBO;2;2836;A hasty return to Cologne concluded this excursion, which had lasted only a week, and from which I returned to face once more the solution of the problems of my Parisian enterprise, now opening out painfully before me.
MusicBO;2;3933;I made a pleasant excursion with the Bulows and the Schnorrs to Bingen one evening, and availed myself of the opportunity to cross over to Rudesheim to bring back Friederike Meyer, who had been enjoying her holiday there.
MusicBO;2;4512;We returned home down the Danube in the small boats of the Rowing Club, of which my hosts were members, and on our way had to face a hurricane, which lashed the mighty stream into the wildest tumult.
MusicBO;2;482;However, I soon got to work, and as I had begun to carry out my great plan by beginning at the end and going backwards, I continued on the same lines with the beginning as my goal.
MusicBO;2;1199;We often met, and I also spent a few evenings at his house in Kensington, when we invariably dropped into the old vein of strange, serious humour that helped us to forget the seamy side of life.
MusicBO;2;3102;But through Truinet I contrived to have my letter published the next day in the Journal des Debats, so that at last, though with great reluctance, the management gave their consent to my withdrawal of the piece.
MusicBO;2;3501;I was not to be deterred from my purpose by my consciousness of the great weakness of his poems, although I realised the unnaturalness of his conceptions and the invariably affected and frequently vulgar form of expression.
MusicBO;2;3940;We made our first halt at Remagen, where we visited the handsome church, in which a young monk was preaching to an immense crowd, and we afterwards lunched in a garden on the bank of the Rhine.
MusicBO;2;170;But when certain bodily ailments compelled him to remain indoors for many days, it was difficult to gain access to him, for the man was apt to become furious when any one inquired about his health.
MusicBO;2;647;Herwegh impressed upon my wife that my wife must insist upon my taking a glass of good wine after all the exertion I underwent at the rehearsals and concerts which I was attending throughout that winter.
MusicBO;2;1365;I chose the Lake of Geneva, and decided to look out for a well-situated country resort in the neighbourhood of Geneva or thereabouts, where I could start on a cure which my Zurich doctor had prescribed.
MusicBO;2;1709;This understanding had a tendency, as time wore on, to assume a doubtful significance in the eyes of other people, and necessitated a certain measure of precaution in an intimacy which had now become exceedingly close.
MusicBO;2;2017;This suited me excellently, and as Ritter also assured me that he knew, from a previous visit, that the climate of Venice was quite agreeable at this season, I was induced to make a hasty departure.
MusicBO;2;2436;In consequence of their endeavours on my behalf I now began to notice the first signs of a hostile, and hitherto unsuspected, attitude towards me and my undertaking on the part of my old friend Berlioz.
MusicBO;2;3750;She was much pleased at my sympathetic inquiry, and informed me that the comedy was not likely to be revived in the immediate future, but that there was a prospect of Calderon's Don Gutierre being produced.
MusicBO;2;3831;I sprang out of bed in a terrified condition, to discover that the sound proceeded from my servant Lieschen, who had been attacked with hysterical convulsions as the girl lay in bed in the room overhead.
MusicBO;2;116;Meanwhile Ritter remained in melancholy retirement, and not being able to make up his mind whether or not Karl Ritter should return to Zurich, where Karl Ritter would be disagreeably reminded of his unlucky debut
MusicBO;2;298;My first glance at my guest, as he landed at the familiar harbour of Rorschach, filled me at once with anxiety for his health, for his health revealed but too plainly his tendency to consumption.
MusicBO;2;592;As my presence was prohibited everywhere, I had recourse to a very detailed pamphlet which was to serve as a guide to the production of my work, and convey a correct idea of my purpose.
MusicBO;2;1168;As I saw him come in it occurred to me immediately that Howard, whom I had only known as the secretary of the Philharmonic Society, was also the musical critic of the Illustrated London News
MusicBO;2;1916;I availed myself of this opportunity to have a lengthy interview at the hotel in Chamberlain von Beaulieu's room, with my former nominal patron whose acquaintance I had made at the time of my flight.
MusicBO;2;2370;The first thing I did was to look up M. de Charnal and to get information from him about the translation of the libretto of my Rienzi with which M. de Charnal had been entrusted.
MusicBO;2;2849;As it was, it had no power to excite in me even the slightest enthusiasm for an undertaking of which the hollowness and unsuitability for me personally were clearly revealed every time I approached it.
MusicBO;2;3059;Both Minna and I stayed away from this, as it was just as embarrassing for me to know that my wife was insulted as to see the singers on the stage subjected to such behaviour.
MusicBO;2;3563;I at once announced my return to Cornelius by sending him a small Venetian gondola, which I had bought for him in Venice, and to which I added a canzona written with nonsensical Italian words.
MusicBO;2;3912;Unfortunately I noticed in her a lively antipathy to her sister Friederike, a fact which, among others, strengthened my conviction that it was high time for Friederike to dissociate herself from all ties in Frankfort.
MusicBO;2;4194;Cornelius and Tausig had again been to see me, but I had to work off my resentment against them both for the fit of real ill-humour their behaviour had caused me in the previous summer.
MusicBO;2;702;I had already taken more roomy apartments on the second floor in the so-called Vorderen Escher Hausern, in which I had before occupied a flat that was much too small on the ground floor.
MusicBO;2;1414;We at once made an excursion with her to my favourite spot, Brunnen on Lake Lucerne, and spent an exquisite evening there enjoying the glorious sunset and other beautiful effects of the Alpine landscape.
MusicBO;2;2010;"It was the most brilliant summer day with a bright, cloudless sky; I remember that I never once looked back, or shed a tear on taking leave of her, and this almost terrified me."
MusicBO;2;2288;While I was at work on the great scene of Tristan, found myself often asking whether I was not mad to want to give such work to a publisher to print for the theatre.
MusicBO;2;3484;I got through the time as best I could, and hit upon the idea of translating back into German the new scene to Tannhauser, written to a French text for the performance in Paris.
MusicBO;2;3880;I had heard so much of his delicate state of health that I was genuinely delighted to see him enter the room with a lively step and a look of joy in his eyes.
MusicBO;2;4273;On considering the matter more deeply, however, I did not see what advantage this would be to me, seeing that I had no further prospect of earning any income in Vienna for my sustenance.
MusicBO;2;4408;With this, however, I was content, considering the magnificent reception accorded to my efforts, and above all the fervid enthusiasm of the orchestra, which was expressed here as it had been in St. Petersburg.
MusicBO;2;445;Soon afterwards I was overpowered by an extraordinary depression in which, somehow, the disappointment about the turn of political events and the reaction created by my exaggerated water cure, almost ruined my health.
MusicBO;2;557;Here we saw something of the habits and customs of a Hamburg household, which was kept up in a fairly prosperous style by his wife, the daughter of Herr Sloman, a wealthy shipowner.
MusicBO;2;611;The only one who entered into it with any heartiness or real enthusiasm was Herwegh, with whom I frequently discussed it, and to whom I generally read aloud such portions as were completed.
MusicBO;2;680;I felt I was fulfilling a sincere desire on the part of a larger circle of acquaintances by introducing them to the true nature of my music, rendered as intelligibly as circumstances permitted.
MusicBO;2;950;What fascinated me so enormously about Schopenhauer's work was not only its extraordinary fate, but the clearness and manly precision with which the most difficult metaphysical problems were treated from the very beginning.
MusicBO;2;1464;For a long time my relations with this family, intimate as this family had been, were painfully strained, as I found it impossible to make them see the incident in the right light.
MusicBO;2;1705;We had become so intimate, through being such near neighbours in a country place, that it was impossible to avoid a marked increase in our intimacy if only through meeting one another daily.
MusicBO;2;1779;I could not help smiling at this strange misconception, but I was also startled at this proof of shallowness in my old friend, and began to wonder what Eduard Devrient might do next.
MusicBO;2;2258;this period was settled that I should take up the Nibelungen work when Tristan was finished, and I thought it my duty to find out some way of making my future existence easier.
MusicBO;2;2513;The first of these took place in the Herz Hall, and led to such an agitation on the part of the musicians against me that it was almost as bad as a riot.
MusicBO;2;2717;As I was thus satisfied about the ability of my two helpers, I visited Royer in order to make my position secure by obtaining his authority for a contract with the two men.
MusicBO;2;2837;One factor which seemed likely greatly to relieve the difficulties confronting me was to be found in the friendly relationship into which the young banker, Emil Erlanger, was pleased to enter towards me.
MusicBO;2;2843;As a result of this invitation I made the acquaintance of a genuinely agreeable man, who, having often heard my music in Germany, had become inspired by a sympathetic interest in my person.
MusicBO;2;3723;The Grand Duke replied by a very kind telegram signed by himself, in response to which I went to Karlsruhe on the 7th March and read my manuscript to him and his wife.
MusicBO;2;3855;She wrote and told me of her recovery and requested me to visit her, because she felt it her duty to apologise to me for the trouble in which she had involved me.
MusicBO;2;3879;I fell in love with him at once, and after the performance I sent him a message to come and see me in my room at the hotel and have a little chat.
MusicBO;2;4441;This was in reference to a few lines I had left behind for her, and it conveyed quite enough to revive my doubts as to the wisdom of carrying out my house-building plans.
MusicBO;2;241;Whenever I saw any likelihood of being again brought into closer contact with the theatre I was filled with an indescribable disgust which, for the time being, I was unable to overcome.
MusicBO;2;430;I based my opinion upon the experience I had had during my last visit to Paris, when I had attended, among other things, a political meeting of the so-called social democratic party.
MusicBO;2;447;I prophesied that the time was approaching when intellectually we should be such paupers that the appearance of a new book from the pen of Heinrich Heine would create quite a sensation.
MusicBO;2;507;So I set out for the ascent of the Gries glacier, and the climb across the pass to the southern side of the Alps, in the company of my sinister guide alone.
MusicBO;2;847;I had again the opportunity of admiring the great artistic zeal with which the French master these treasures of music, which even to this day are so coarsely handled by the Germans.
MusicBO;2;1220;In the province of music, with which I was more concerned, I have still to mention several of the Sacred-Music Society's concerts, which I attended in the large room at Exeter Hall.
MusicBO;2;1273;I suffered from innumerable attacks of erysipelas during the whole winter, each fresh attack (in consequence of some tiny error of diet, or of the least cold) being attended by violent pain.
MusicBO;2;1568;I had enlisted the services of my friend Hagenbuch, the Cantonal Secretary, to use all his influence to secure me a few acres of land at this spot as cheaply as possible.
MusicBO;2;2179;And now in the early months of the year the orchestration of this act, which I continued to send in groups of sheets to the publisher to be engraved, also neared completion.
MusicBO;2;2257;I was beginning to exhaust the little that I could contrive to extract with difficulty from those of my operas which up to this period this period had been possible to produce.
MusicBO;2;2381;This lifted a load from my heart: I accepted the invitation which Leroy arranged for me through another friend, who took me down to Roger's country place one day to meet him.
MusicBO;2;2581;I felt when I learned that a collection was being made for me amongst the Germans in Paris to indemnify me for the expense I had incurred in giving the three concerts.
MusicBO;2;2637;This new turn of affairs put me into a state of vague agitation, for at first my inner conviction could only make me feel that singular misunderstandings would be sure to arise.
MusicBO;2;2852;M. Royer informed me that M. Royer could not 'pass' the translation which I had taken infinite pains to conjure into existence through the two men who had volunteered to help me.
MusicBO;2;3803;The certainty with which the sick lady had immediately recognised the symptoms of a disease, which in most cases can only be caught from children, could not fail to impress me strangely.
MusicBO;2;3890;As Devrient, by his ingenious attitude, had led the Grand Duke to believe in his profound and genuinely solicitous friendship for me, my communications obviously pained the Grand Duke a great deal.
MusicBO;2;4028;I was genuinely astonished to hear this, and on further inquiry arrived at the following elucidation of the transactions that had been taking place on my behalf in Vienna during the interval.
MusicBO;2;4751;I announced my intention to my friends there immediately, but decided first to try and provide myself with enough money to be in a position to suggest a composition with my creditors.
MusicBO;2;449;I was now compelled to pay a great deal of attention to my physical condition, as it gave me much cause for anxiety and necessitated a complete change in my methods.
MusicBO;2;706;I had the flat so charmingly furnished with carpets and decorative furniture that Liszt himself was surprised into admiration as Liszt himself entered my 'petite elegance', as Liszt himself called it.
MusicBO;2;709;Later on, I had the opportunity of describing in detail the impressions I received at this time in a letter which I wrote to Marie von Wittgenstein, which was afterwards published.
MusicBO;2;742;We had confidently looked forward to exceptional enjoyment in thus penetrating beyond the precipices of the great Mont Bernina, to which we gave the palm for beauty above Mont Blanc itself.
MusicBO;2;1839;They declared they had thoroughly entered into the spirit of the various selections I had played from my operas in my now characteristic fashion, and that they had enjoyed them immensely.
MusicBO;2;1987;So the house was suddenly filled, and the table surrounded by sad, mysteriously depressed guests, whose wants were ministered to by one who was shortly to leave her home for ever.
MusicBO;2;2870;I can hardly remember ever meeting a man of such sound judgment on the most difficult points, or one so actively ready when occasion arose to uphold the view I advocated.
MusicBO;2;3181;Under these circumstances I could only feel indifferent to the many sympathetic advances and assurances which reached me with ever-growing cordiality, although at the same time they filled me with apprehension.
MusicBO;2;3671;I now determined to go at once to Mayence, and ordered all our furniture and household goods, which had been stored in Paris for nearly a year, to be sent there.
MusicBO;2;4300;Not finding what I wanted, I finally entered into treaty with Frickhofer for the erection of a small cottage on a plot of land I proposed to buy near his villa.
MusicBO;2;4459;In what had been the pleasant abode of old Baron von Rackowitz at Penzing, I was offered the most delightful accommodation for a yearly rent of two thousand four hundred marks.
MusicBO;2;4598;I next had to face the question whether, after the toilsome fatigue of the past weeks, I would add to my disappointments by attempting to give the proposed concert in Dresden.
MusicBO;2;292;I decided to go as far as Rorschach, on the Lake of Constance, to meet him, so that we might make an excursion through the Alps as far as Zurich.
MusicBO;2;455;I tormented him with my persistent paradoxes all through supper to such an extent that Professor Osenbruck positively loathed me, and ever afterwards carefully avoided coming into contact with me.
MusicBO;2;1091;This was the explanation given me when the signs of appreciation, which I had become accustomed to receive from the players in the course of our work together, suddenly ceased.
MusicBO;2;1222;Neither could I refuse to recognise the great precision of the chorus of seven hundred voices, which reached quite a respectable standard on a few occasions, particularly in Handel's Messiah.
MusicBO;2;1288;Thus I spent the winter, calm and resigned in my productive moments, but moody and irritable towards the outside world, and consequently a source of some anxiety to my friends.
MusicBO;2;1536;The next day, the 24th of November, we all met, for various festivities, in the house of an ardent lover of music, Herr Bourit, a rich merchant of St. Gall.
MusicBO;2;1704;At this point a new phase began in my relations with this family, which was not really important, but nevertheless exercised considerable influence on the outward conduct of my life.
MusicBO;2;1723;I invited them to my little house, so that they might spend the whole time of their stay in Zurich with me, as their visit was mainly on my account.
MusicBO;2;1738;At the beginning of October, however, I at once began to compose Tristan, finishing the first act by the new year, when I was already engaged in orchestrating the prelude.
MusicBO;2;2168;As is the case with all such works, which are in reality always hampered by the superficiality of the dilettante, much should have been altered and rewritten for stage effect.
MusicBO;2;2348;We made it up before we parted that night, and met again on several occasions after this, when we took care never again to let our discussions become so passionate.
MusicBO;2;2396;I had to remain uncertain as to the precise reason why this undertaking had been given up, which at an earlier stage had apparently been pursued with so much zeal.
MusicBO;2;2537;These I obtained with great difficulty, through Gasperini's mediation, from the very man to win whose assistance in a much wider sense had been the whole object of the concerts.
MusicBO;2;4034;All this was said in such a burst of emotion that I could do nothing but soothe his grief and promise him my unreserved sympathy with his work in future.
MusicBO;2;4392;I was to give three concerts in the Grand Theatre, of which I was to have half the receipts, guaranteed in each case at a minimum of one thousand roubles.
MusicBO;2;4689;In this perplexity I addressed myself with perfect frankness—at first only for advice—to the judge of the Imperial Provincial Court, Eduard Liszt, the youthful uncle of my old friend Franz.
MusicBO;2;4745;I wrote back in great indignation, particularly as I realised the prejudicial effect of this on my landlord, to whom I had to pay rent within the next few days.
MusicBO;2;4769;I had told him that I was going to send it to him almost immediately when I attacked him about the advances which had so long been withheld from me.
MusicBO;2;4788;At five o'clock that afternoon I met Herr Pfistermeister at the station to travel with him to Munich, where my visit to the King was announced for the following morning.
MusicBO;2;70;Strange to say, this trying experience coincided with an important change in the life of another young friend of mine, Hans von Bulow, whom I had known in Dresden.
MusicBO;2;119;I also took an active part in it by conducting one of Beethoven's symphonies, and it was a great pleasure to us both to give each other mutual encouragement.
MusicBO;2;267;The question thus raised regarding the significance of the modern Jew in music stimulated me to make a closer examination of Jewish influence and the characteristics peculiar to it.
MusicBO;2;405;I considered that I had had quite enough of the cure, and comforted myself with the hope that I should derive benefit from My water cure in the future.
MusicBO;2;417;Sulzer said Sulzer would not at all object to the intoxication resulting from intercourse with women, but in his opinion the difficulty lay in procuring this by fair means.
MusicBO;2;516;We arrived at last at the opening of the upper valley which gives on to the Formazza valley, to which a steep cutting, covered with snow and ice, led.
MusicBO;2;1143;I invited him to be present at my last concert, and also at a small farewell feast which I was giving at home to my few friends after it.
MusicBO;2;1492;As soon as Liszt was a little better, we quickly went to the piano again to try over by ourselves my two finished scores of Rheingold and the Walkure.
MusicBO;2;2053;On one of my first promenades on the Riva I was accosted by two strangers, one of whom introduced himself as Count Edmund Zichy, the other as Prince Dolgoroukow.
MusicBO;2;2407;My immediate and besetting care was then to discover in Paris a suitable man for the task, who would undertake the execution of my plan at his own risk.
MusicBO;2;2790;It was just at this moment that an improvement took place in my relations with the King of Saxony, who had hitherto obstinately opposed to grant me an amnesty.
MusicBO;2;3153;M. Erlanger believed M. Erlanger could succeed in getting ten bankers to guarantee fifty thousand francs, thus placing a sum of five hundred thousand francs at M. Perrin's disposal.
MusicBO;2;3240;Another day we met for lunch at Gounod's, when we had a very dull time, which was only enlivened by poor Baudelaire, who indulged in the most outrageous witticisms.
MusicBO;2;3607;I insisted emphatically on carrying out my first proposal, namely, that he should provide me for two successive years with funds necessary for the undisturbed execution of my work.
MusicBO;2;3684;I was much struck by the sympathetic concern of the Grand Duke as to how I could meet the cost of my arduous life, or even my travelling expenses.
MusicBO;2;4133;My first impression was one of extraordinary boredom and emptiness, for I had last seen them filled with barricades, in which fantastic condition they had looked so unusually interesting.
MusicBO;2;4593;I was again summoned to the royal box, where I found all the court gathered round the Queen, who wore a blue rose on her forehead as an ornament.
MusicBO;2;4687;By this time it had become clear that, under the conditions thus developed, I could no longer reckon on maintaining my position in Vienna, or my establishment at Penzing.
MusicBO;2;193;His contributions to our monthly journal, during the brief term of his stay in Zurich, were certainly among the best ever written on these topics by a German.
MusicBO;2;221;This example gave the lead to many other journals, and for some time This example seemed as though the otherwise dull-witted musical press would energetically champion my cause.
MusicBO;2;335;Uhlig brought me a book on the subject by a certain Rausse, which pleased me greatly, especially by its radical principles, which had something of Feuerbach about them.
MusicBO;2;560;Herwegh's chief companion seemed to have taken up with Herwegh with the object of overcoming the latter's antipathy to Alpine climbing, and his consequent reluctance to undertake it.
MusicBO;2;788;At Genoa I again felt so agreeably stimulated that I suddenly thought I had only yielded to some foolish weakness, and resolved to carry out my original plan.
MusicBO;2;852;It was quite a novelty to me to see Liszt with these young girls, and to watch him in his intercourse with his son, then a growing lad.
MusicBO;2;871;This young man (who had been born since the early days of my friendship with his father) had devoted himself passionately to music, as so many do nowadays.
MusicBO;2;1416;Two boats, illuminated by coloured lanterns, came up to the beach facing our hotel, bearing the Brunnen brass band, which was formed entirely of amateurs from the countryside.
MusicBO;2;1805;In the former I soon found a very taking and active friend, who at once resolutely took in hand the matter which was my chief object in Paris.
MusicBO;2;2246;But the terrible influence of the weather, which was intensely cold and continuously wet, weighed upon my spirits in a most unfriendly fashion until the end of May.
MusicBO;2;2251;I spent some days in my friends' house, where I saw my old Zurich acquaintances again, and felt as though I were passing from one dream to another.
MusicBO;2;2749;I had almost become involved in fresh complications in consequence, when one day Count Paul Hatzfeld appeared at my house with a request that I would visit Mme.
MusicBO;2;2970;The atmosphere created by this conviction now weighed with increasing pressure upon everything which was undertaken for the preparation of a performance which was postponed time after time.
MusicBO;2;3332;I reached Weimar at two in the morning, and was conducted later in the day to the rooms which Liszt had arranged for my use at the Altenburg.
MusicBO;2;3631;"The Olliviers also appeared to receive me with an air of distrust; at any rate, they thought it very strange to see me again so soon in Paris."
MusicBO;2;3805;He took Friederike at once under his protection, and treated her with the greatest care, thus relieving me from the pangs of anxiety aroused by this strange case.
MusicBO;2;3833;While I was horrified at the thought that the girl would soon die, I could not help wondering at the curious tranquillity of the others who were present.
MusicBO;2;3922;He himself explained this to me by observing that he had stepped out of something like a shell in which he had been ensconced for his own preservation.
MusicBO;2;3944;Two gentlemen who had joined us on the way from the Drachenfels immediately offered to retrace their steps, a somewhat arduous undertaking, to hunt for the lost object.
MusicBO;2;4104;My brother-in-law was not to be deterred by these painful impressions from carrying out the household festivities, which had been arranged beforehand in celebration of my expected triumphs.
MusicBO;2;4178;Although her weakness increased, and she suffered from constant insomnia, she still tried, in her magnanimity and her shame, to hide from me the awkwardness of her situation.
MusicBO;2;4767;I expected nothing further of him than a little assistance in looking for a quiet lodging for the coming summer at Cannstadt or some such place near Stuttgart.
MusicBO;2;166;But as I insisted upon attaching an importance to the artistic destiny of mankind which far transcended the mere aims of citizenship, I sometimes completely upset him.
MusicBO;2;419;As my friends studied me and my condition more closely, my friends felt my friends had reason to be very anxious about my foolish and obstinate extravagances.
MusicBO;2;570;We dutifully visited the so-called Mer de Glace in the Val de Chamounix and the Flegere, from which I obtained a most impressive view of Mont Blanc.
MusicBO;2;593;I had this somewhat voluminous work printed at my own expense and tastefully bound, and to every theatre that had given an order for the operatic score
MusicBO;2;790;And indeed, as soon as I made up my mind to alter this plan, the old condition set in once more, with all the symptoms of dysentery.
MusicBO;2;888;"I remember how much my health improved during the writing of this work; and my surroundings during that time consequently left very little impression on my mind."
MusicBO;2;901;Towards the end of July I had finished the first scene, but had to interrupt my work on account of a journey to the south of Switzerland.
MusicBO;2;1692;I was astonished to make the acquaintance of entirely new melodies, sung by singers whose forms I could not see and whose names I did not know.
MusicBO;2;1864;I offered to bring together a respectable orchestra to perform fragments of the Beethoven symphonies, consisting mainly of the brighter parts, for the entertainment of the company.
MusicBO;2;2285;To this day it is a subject of regret to me not to have been able to introduce this fresh piece of work into the engraved score.
MusicBO;2;2495;In the event of Schott accepting my offer, I immediately formed a plan of spending the sum thus unexpectedly acquired for the furthering of my Paris undertaking.
MusicBO;2;2643;With this object in view I decided at once to carry out an undertaking suggested to me by Giacomelli, namely, a repetition of my concerts in Brussels.
MusicBO;2;2800;Amid these anxieties, and indeed throughout all my previous worries, I was again suffering from my old malady, which now seemed to have settled in my abdomen.
MusicBO;2;2846;And, in fact, so far as my subsequent financial security was concerned, I had no further difficulties to encounter until my position in Paris was fully decided.
MusicBO;2;2869;His value, however, as an experienced, warm-hearted, staunchly devoted friend at all times, especially in periods of the greatest distress, made itself more and more clearly felt.
MusicBO;2;3398;We were first of all rejoiced to find Cosima's state of health much less alarming than we—I in particular—had known Cosima's state of health to be before.
MusicBO;2;3427;She showed me a small room in which I could sleep if I liked, but was apparently unable to provide either linen or service of any kind.
MusicBO;2;3771;He was my neighbour, and I had so often met him on my lonely walks in the park, that I considered it polite to call on him.
MusicBO;2;4096;My family, observing us from a distance, were offended by the almost incessant laughter which possessed us, as my family themselves were in the depths of depression.
MusicBO;2;4163;She won my sympathy once more by her conduct and determination, which I had to consider as a powerful refutation of the calumnies brought up against her.
MusicBO;2;338;I naturally thought of the disagreeable sulphur baths I had taken during the spring, and to which I attributed my chronic and severe state of irritability.
MusicBO;2;349;There we climbed the Hufi glacier, whence we enjoyed a splendid view over an impressive panorama of mountains, bounded at this point by the Tody range.
MusicBO;2;904;I intended on the way to call on Karl Ritter, who had gone to live with his young wife at Montreux on the Lake of Geneva.
MusicBO;2;1304;I had worried myself for a long time about him too, trying to think that his previous efforts were merely introductions to really serious artistic achievements.
MusicBO;2;1477;But a really refreshing sense of freedom and spontaneity pervaded everything, and the unceremonious evenings at my house in particular were really remarkably free and easy.
MusicBO;2;1584;"It is true, that most of the essentials in this respect were carried out by the proprietor; but no end of difficulties remained to be solved."
MusicBO;2;1699;His visit, in other respects, was a source of genuine pleasure to me, for I was bound to recognise in him a faithful and life-long friend.
MusicBO;2;1701;This was a source of considerable annoyance to me, as with the best will in the world, I could not muster up any sympathy for him.
MusicBO;2;2109;The populace, too, behaved with no less reserve, or one might even say hostility, to the clergy, who were for the most part of Italian origin.
MusicBO;2;2669;After this, whenever I saw Lohengrin again, I could not restrain a smile at the scene-painter's castle, perched aloft in the background on its stately mountain.
MusicBO;2;2892;She did not conceal her satisfaction at having secured an engagement at the Paris Opera through my unwilling choice of her for the part of Venus.
MusicBO;2;2921;My relations had to go home, leaving me behind in a state of unconsciousness, in which I was consigned to the care of my friend Gasperini.
MusicBO;2;3138;But a much more important result than these was that people began to recognise the reality of my popularity, and began to plan yet greater undertakings.
MusicBO;2;3505;Hebbel talked about the theatrical world in Vienna with the air of an amateur who feels himself neglected but continues to work in a businesslike fashion.
MusicBO;2;3524;Accordingly he tried by perpetual expressions of zeal and goodwill to conceal the increasing spirit of doubt and hesitation with which even the staff was imbued.
MusicBO;2;3606;Notwithstanding all this I had to recognise that in Franz Schott I was dealing with a very singular man, and our negotiations proceeded with extraordinary difficulty.
MusicBO;2;4483;I could only regard it as purposeless and risky to accede to this wish just then, though I kept the idea in reserve for the future.
MusicBO;2;4663;"I felt thoroughly sanguine; I could now greet my few friends with tolerable good-humour, and among them Peter Cornelius, who looked in on me every evening."
MusicBO;2;345;By way of quieting my uneasiness about him, he at once exclaimed that this was a very good way of carrying out the water cure.
MusicBO;2;368;I begged of her, however, to devote herself during my absence to the task of furnishing and arranging our new flat as comfortably as possible.
MusicBO;2;393;The news reached him here of the sudden death of a rich uncle, who had left a considerable fortune to every member of Karl's family.
MusicBO;2;595;But from that time I have never heard of a single person who had either read this pamphlet or taken any notice of this pamphlet.
MusicBO;2;616;I had often entertained these ladies with music in my own peculiar fashion during my pleasant visits to Mariafeld, about two hours' walk from Zurich.
MusicBO;2;725;But I still felt the peculiar disinclination and fear of taking up composing again that I had previously experienced after protracted pauses in musical production.
MusicBO;2;853;Liszt himself seemed to feel strange in his fatherly position, which for several years had only brought him cares, without any of the attendant pleasures.
MusicBO;2;1146;I took pleasure in the society of Mr. Ellerton, a dignified, agreeable man, the brother-in-law of Lord Brougham—a poet, a music-lover, and, alas! a composer.
MusicBO;2;1271;But my income, owing to the conscientious stewardship of my friend Sulzer, was now sufficient to permit me to work without anxiety on that account.
MusicBO;2;1425;I could not wait so long, however, before beginning the composition of Siegfried, and I began to sketch the overture on the 22nd of September.
MusicBO;2;1846;As soon as I arrived I was irresistibly drawn into Chandon's hospitable house, and could not refuse to remain there for a couple of days.
MusicBO;2;1847;I found in Chandon a passionate admirer of my operas, particularly of Rienzi, the first performance of which he had witnessed during his Dresden days.
MusicBO;2;2014;I arranged to stay for a month at the Maison Fazy, deluding myself into the idea that a lengthy stay there would be very pleasant.
MusicBO;2;2234;The courteous manager of the hotel, Colonel Segesser, allotted to me a whole floor in the annexe on the left, to occupy at my pleasure.
MusicBO;2;2330;But the question was, where was I to turn for a place in which to settle with some prospect of being able to remain there.
MusicBO;2;2364;But I was puzzled that the building, in spite of my being unable to detect anything old in its structure, had been so neglected inside.
MusicBO;2;2404;I rapidly sketched a plan for starting a German theatre in Paris itself, such as had existed in bygone years with the co-operation of Schroder-Devrient.
MusicBO;2;2600;Only by obtaining this, and having no preliminary expenses in consequence, could I gain the benefit which was becoming more and more necessary to me.
MusicBO;2;2649;But I had not seen her on that occasion, and I now had the pleasant surprise of being invited to call upon her in Brussels.
MusicBO;2;2934;But I was much elated and pleased to see that the translation of the four operatic librettos which had so far appeared had been published.
MusicBO;2;4071;His concert programme was in fact filled with a great number of his own compositions, including a symphonic poem, just completed, entitled Der Ritter Toggenburg.
MusicBO;2;4432;On discovering this friendly interest, I could not help regretting that the connection thus formed was not likely to have more stable and profitable results.
MusicBO;2;150;The good man was fully convinced that in the opinions expressed in this article I should find a preliminary basis for my own theories.
MusicBO;2;854;On this occasion we again resumed our reading of the last act of Gotterdammerung, which brought us to the longed-for end of the tetralogy.
MusicBO;2;942;Meanwhile I plunged with renewed zeal into my work, and had finished a fair copy of the Rheingold score by the 26th of September.
MusicBO;2;949;I seemed to understand the reason of their failure to satisfy me from the writings of Feuerbach, which I studied at the same time.
MusicBO;2;982;I jotted down the incidents of the three acts in a concise form, with the intention of working them out more elaborately later on.
MusicBO;2;1062;Still I went on hoping that the impression produced by the performances I conducted might even here justify the demand for a special effort.
MusicBO;2;1544;Great was my surprise, therefore, when before long I received the news that my visitors were making a sojourn of some duration in Munich.
MusicBO;2;1582;Our installation in this house, which occupied me heart and soul at the beginning of the spring, was not achieved without many a disappointment.
MusicBO;2;1838;We spent a rather charming evening there, during which, strange to say, I had to be responsible for the musical entertainment at the piano.
MusicBO;2;1882;I could not help realising that this was henceforth to be the intolerable character of the conjugal relations I had resumed eight years before.
MusicBO;2;1934;He played the most complicated pieces at sight, and knew how to use his astonishing facility in the most extravagant tricks for my entertainment.
MusicBO;2;2389;He sang to me the French text of some of the main themes which he had already translated, and they seemed to me good.
MusicBO;2;2564;Here an old acquaintance of mine, Malwida von Meysenburg, again came across me, and from that time forth became a close friend for life.
MusicBO;2;2685;And this the man did with such precision that one might easily have thought that the man had the actual music before his eyes.
MusicBO;2;2766;I was never clear as to the effect produced upon both performers and listeners by the presentation under such circumstances of this extraordinary selection.
MusicBO;2;2904;In the midst of all this work I was afforded some recreation by a visit from my sister Louise with part of her family.
MusicBO;2;3118;Our earlier general meetings were chiefly occupied with arrangements and preparations for a great classical concert, for which I also was to compose something.
MusicBO;2;3180;I arrived here, after an absence of only six days, and my sole occupation was to provide money for the needs of the moment.
MusicBO;2;3247;Liszt was also summoned to a dinner at the Tuileries, to which, however, it was not thought necessary to invite me to accompany him.
MusicBO;2;3286;For this work I needed several weeks, which this work was impossible for me to spend in our apartments, now entirely stripped of furniture.
MusicBO;2;3303;Thus I frequently spent the evenings in familiar intercourse with my amiable hosts, and was even seduced into trying to instruct them about Schopenhauer.
MusicBO;2;3385;A fat and elderly innkeeper repeated the name several times with the information that visitors had arrived, and a woman answered him with oaths.
MusicBO;2;3503;I did not find any expression in the poet's personality of the eccentric force which threatens to explode in the figures of his dramas.
MusicBO;2;3818;The more calmly I acted in this matter, the more deeply Mathilde Maier seemed to be offended by the quiet frigidity of my letters.
MusicBO;2;3921;I was astounded to find absolutely no radical change in the appearance of my old acquaintance, except for the faded colour of his hair.
MusicBO;2;4248;"At this moment I chanced to see in one of the boxes a most comforting omen for my present position; for I recognised Mme."
MusicBO;2;4399;Among these was one of my old Riga acquaintances, the 'cellist von Lutzau, who in those days had a great reputation as a wag.
MusicBO;2;4622;I was met at one of the stations in Silesia by Conductor Seifriz, who accompanied me in one of the Prince's carriages to Lowenberg.
MusicBO;2;4624;The old Prince of Hohenzollern-Hechingen had invited me to give a concert in his small castle to an audience composed exclusively of invited guests.
MusicBO;2;39;I was very much grieved on this occasion to discover that my wife had symptoms of heart disease, which continued to develop subsequently.
MusicBO;2;376;I easily persuaded him to follow me shortly to Albisbrunnen to undergo a thorough treatment for an infirmity from which he was suffering.
MusicBO;2;505;He feared that I had allowed myself to be taken in by his adversary, and had consequently formed an unfavourable opinion of him.
MusicBO;2;567;I was therefore eager to see what was best worth seeing in Switzerland as thoroughly as possible now that I had the chance.
MusicBO;2;891;The necessity for altering the finale by Mozart induced me to write an article for the Brendel musical journal on this artistic problem.
MusicBO;2;1016;Before following him to England, I had to free myself from a calamity which I had brought upon myself through being too kind-hearted.
MusicBO;2;1094;But it was the personal relations which grew out of my stay in London that provided the strangest aspect of my life there.
MusicBO;2;1241;And so I returned to Zurich, full of cheerful impressions, on the 30th of June, my net profits being exactly one thousand francs.
MusicBO;2;1250;From him I obtained a deadly dose, which I carried home across the lake in my solitary skiff on an exquisite summer evening.
MusicBO;2;1369;In Geneva I put up first at the familiar old Hotel de l'Ecu de Geneve, which called up various reminiscences to my mind.
MusicBO;2;2426;For this I had to address myself to the Emperor Napoleon, which I did in a concise letter composed for me by Gasperini.
MusicBO;2;2765;Viardot had specially charged herself with securing his presence, apparently with the avowed object of easing the strained relations between Berlioz and myself.
MusicBO;2;2865;His chief interests lay in the administration of the Grand Opera, to which this last collaborator was attached as keeper of the archives.
MusicBO;2;2937;He was a highly intelligent translator, and had now done me such admirable service that every one recognised the value of his work.
MusicBO;2;2945;But I could not fail to notice at the same time that the attitude of all those who took part was substantially altered.
MusicBO;2;2981;From all sides the friends of my past life gathered together in Paris to be present at the apotheosis of the first performance.
MusicBO;2;3224;The wonderfully clear air decided me to try the long and circuitous path through the familiar haunts of the Sihlthal to Wesendonck's estate.
MusicBO;2;3536;Consequently the next thing I had to do was to look out for a residence, which I chose in the Hotel Kaiserin Elizabeth.
MusicBO;2;3698;As we had already arranged, I began in company with Schott to search for a residence on the opposite bank of the Rhine.
MusicBO;2;3785;With both these gentlemen I now weighed all the possibilities of acquiring, or at least of discovering, my little castle for the future.
MusicBO;2;3992;We now noticed with astonishment that all further conversation was carried on between them as a duologue which was quite unintelligible to us.
MusicBO;2;4079;Our emotions were so genuinely deep and sincere that only an unconditional surrender to the enjoyment of meeting again could bridge the chasm.
MusicBO;2;4207;But we eventually resumed our lively and sociable habits when I began seriously to carry out my project of giving concerts in Vienna.
MusicBO;2;4402;But even these men could not dispel my feeling that in dealing with this Moscow orchestra I had descended in the artistic scale.
MusicBO;2;4559;I was also advised to apply to Hans von Bronsart, who at this time was conductor to a private orchestral society in Dresden.
MusicBO;2;4576;My relations with him were strictly official, but Eduard Devrient's certainly carried out my instructions for the arrangement of the orchestra very correctly.
MusicBO;2;47;I was more interested in the future of the young friend who had been entrusted to my care than in anything else.
MusicBO;2;537;I admired the daintiness of the house decorations and the pleasant faces of the people in the pretty villages I passed through.
MusicBO;2;679;As a matter of fact, the performances could hardly be called public concerts, but were rather of the nature of family entertainments.
MusicBO;2;724;Apart from this confusion, for which I was responsible, that evening's ceremony and its effects on me were very cheerful and beneficial.
MusicBO;2;768;My only object still was to find a refuge where I might enjoy the congenial peace suited to some new artistic creation.
MusicBO;2;791;I thereupon understood myself, and giving up the journey to Nice, I returned direct by the nearest route via Alessandria and Novara.
MusicBO;2;832;Our journey to Paris and our stay there were full of important incidents, and left indelible traces of our exceptionally devoted friendship.
MusicBO;2;964;The effect thus gradually wrought upon me was extraordinary, and certainly exerted a decisive influence on the whole course of my life.
MusicBO;2;1267;From outside I received news of the steady persistence with which my Tannhauser was, little by little, being propagated in German theatres.
MusicBO;2;1511;Goodness knows that I myself had a bad enough reputation with my friends for my own irritability and sudden outbursts of temper!
MusicBO;2;1835;I was disappointed in it, not only as far as it was concerned, but also by his singularly dry and theatrical delivery.
MusicBO;2;2024;For the first time I felt my mind entirely at rest, and filled with the hope of a new and harmonious future.
MusicBO;2;2110;I saw a procession of clerics in their vestments passing along the Piazza San Marco accompanied by the people with unconcealed derision.
MusicBO;2;2116;The singing of a popular choral society, trained by an official of the Venetian arsenal generally sang only three-part naturally harmonised folk-songs.
MusicBO;2;2303;Two good horn-players gave me great pleasure by providing a performance of simple folk-songs almost regularly in a skiff on the lake.
MusicBO;2;2478;Here I sought to divert her thoughts by acquainting her with my public position, which as my wife Minna would naturally share.
MusicBO;2;2651;I dined with them several times, and met Count and Countess Condenhoven, the latter being a daughter of my old friend Mme.
MusicBO;2;2670;On returning to Paris at the end of March my sole anxiety was how to repair my impecunious and therefore hopeless position.
MusicBO;2;2791;I owed this to the growing interest now taken in me by the other German embassies, especially those of Austria and Prussia.
MusicBO;2;2802;The painter Czermak, a friendly young man, whom Fraulein Meysenburg had introduced to me, offered his help for the necessary riding lessons.
MusicBO;2;3011;I took counsel with them as to the means at my disposal for forbidding Tannhauser to be performed at the Opera House.
MusicBO;2;3019;At present I had to suffer the annoyance of being unable to serve many of my friends as I should have liked.
MusicBO;2;3053;Hearing that in spite of everything a third performance was fixed, I was confronted with only two possible solutions of the difficulty.
MusicBO;2;3279;But it cost me a rare expenditure of persuasion to induce the absent owner's housekeeper to give me permission to do so.
MusicBO;2;3469;There I ordered a lunch in the garden of the beautifully situated inn, and enjoyed an extremely refreshing hour of complete solitude.
MusicBO;2;3932;It was a horrible picture, and I was confronted with it once afterwards when it was exhibited by the artist in Frankfort.
MusicBO;2;3967;I grew alarmed, and hurriedly went to another table in the hope of counteracting the effect of Cosima's unguided and misguided efforts.
MusicBO;2;4060;A considerable crowd, which had gathered on the station to watch the departure of a prince replied, 'Yes, it was very funny.'
MusicBO;2;4088;The actual concert itself gave a final ghostly touch to an adventure to which we had looked forward so contentedly till then.
MusicBO;2;4095;At a little distance away, and facing this lady, I took a seat next to Cosima while the concert was in progress.
MusicBO;2;4117;He was certainly not mistaken in counting on the excellent effect his binding generosity to me would have on our common friend.
MusicBO;2;4235;In addition to the expense of hiring the place, I had to bear the cost of the requisite extension of the orchestra.
MusicBO;2;4371;On the other hand, she assumed a more serious air when she informed me that she was engaged to Hans von Bronsart.
MusicBO;2;4542;But whenever I settled down seriously to work, I was goaded afresh by an uneasy apprehension as to the means of subsistence.
MusicBO;2;4739;Among other things we touched upon the necessity of obtaining a divorce from my wife in order to contract a rich marriage.
MusicBO;2;52;Consequently I had no reason to discourage the young man's confidence in his capacity for the career of a musical director.
MusicBO;2;185;This man made an indelible impression on my mind as the only instance I have met of a really tactful editor.
MusicBO;2;305;I had to send back the guide for him, who, at our request, succeeded in bringing him along, half by force.
MusicBO;2;315;I heard from him afterwards when Karl had settled for some time in Stuttgart, where Karl seemed to be doing well.
MusicBO;2;506;I told him to make his mind easy on that score, and to meet me again, if possible, in Italian Switzerland.
MusicBO;2;542;from there I proceeded to Lugano, intending, if I followed out my original plan of travel, to stay there some time.
MusicBO;2;849;If, therefore, I had nothing else to remind me of my stay in Paris, this would have been an unfading memory.
MusicBO;2;860;At this house, as well as at a dinner-party given by Liszt at the Palais Royal, I again met his children.
MusicBO;2;961;Now at last I could understand my Wotan, and I returned with chastened mind to the renewed study of Schopenhauer's book.
MusicBO;2;993;I promised to conduct, but only on condition that The Zurich Musical Society would give serious consideration to improving the orchestra.
MusicBO;2;1046;Now I found them living together in a pretty house like a married couple, each tenderly concerned for his friend's welfare.
MusicBO;2;1166;When I went to say good-bye to Mr. Howard on leaving London, I was surprised to meet Meyerbeer at his house.
MusicBO;2;1520;We moved there and then, not without attracting the attention of our neighbours, upon whom, however, the circumstance made no impression.
MusicBO;2;2200;Day by day the Riva was so crowded with troops newly disembarked, that the Riva became quite unavailable for a promenade.
MusicBO;2;2229;This afforded the immense staff of the ballet an opportunity for displaying the most varied picturesque effects in highly characteristic costumes.
MusicBO;2;2612;His hope that the latter might eventually express a desire to have me presented to him had so far remained unfulfilled.
MusicBO;2;2616;At Homes, and at last brought me the news that there was a distinct movement in my favour at the Tuileries.
MusicBO;2;2663;Nevertheless, my stay in Brussels, including a short trip from there to Antwerp, had served to distract my thoughts a little.
MusicBO;2;2740;I was and still continued to be without any prospect of meeting my household expenses, which had now become very heavy.
MusicBO;2;2799;But before this project could be realised I had still to endure the most harassing torments with my translators of Tannhauser.
MusicBO;2;2860;From this time forward we had to keep Lindau away from the slightest interference in this new modelling of the 'book.'
MusicBO;2;2926;At last I insisted on being taken to Naples, where I promised myself a speedy recovery in free intercourse with Garibaldi.
MusicBO;2;3424;To my surprise I at once discovered that I was in an exceedingly remote suburb, practically cut off from Vienna itself.
MusicBO;2;3470;The wild birds had already ceased singing, but I shared my meal with an army of sparrows, which assumed alarming proportions.
MusicBO;2;3595;Fortunately I was able to protest against this calumny by producing proof of what I had actually done in the matter.
MusicBO;2;3883;I undertook to stay another day, so as to avail myself of an invitation to lunch with Schnorr and his wife.
MusicBO;2;3985;I accompanied them as far as Frankfort, where we spent two more days together to see a performance of Goethe's Tasso.
MusicBO;2;4136;It turned out to be Karl Kummer of the court orchestra (looking much older), the most inspired oboist I ever met.
MusicBO;2;4165;She proposed to stop a day at Nuremberg, where I could pick her up for the next stage of the journey.
MusicBO;2;4285;Consequently early in February I set out for that city, and had every reason to be satisfied with my reception there.
MusicBO;2;4294;I hurried back to Vienna again in order to put the arrangement for Tristan on as firm a basis as possible.
MusicBO;2;4318;the police were apparently searching for various persons suspected of complicity in the latest Polish insurrection, which had just broken out.
MusicBO;2;4387;From some of them I heard such exclamations as, 'We must admit we have never known what music is till now.'
MusicBO;2;4460;I could have the entire upper part of the house and the exclusive use of a shady and fairly large garden.
MusicBO;2;192;It was a pity that this talented man never succeeded in making a name for himself by more important work.
MusicBO;2;222;I shall shortly have occasion to describe what it was that eventually gave quite a different direction to this movement.
MusicBO;2;242;It was some little consolation to discover that bodily ill-health might possibly be at the bottom of this mental disorder.
MusicBO;2;243;During the spring of this year I had been suffering from a curious rash, which spread over my whole body.
MusicBO;2;470;I longed to get well enough to be able to take in hand the completion of my combined Nibelungen poem.
MusicBO;2;492;, we made up our minds to return to our cosy winter residence in Zurich at the end of June.
MusicBO;2;548;After a few days' time I began to wonder why I had come, and what I wanted to do here,
MusicBO;2;807;I knew him to be a champion of our cause through having read his articles under the pseudonym of 'Hoplit.'
MusicBO;2;975;This must have been partly due to the serious mood created by Schopenhauer, which was trying to find ecstatic expression.
MusicBO;2;1032;Ferdinand Prager proved to be an unusually good-natured fellow, though of an excitability insufficiently balanced by his standard of culture.
MusicBO;2;1041;I was much affected when I heard, later on, of the incident which had made these two men inseparable friends.
MusicBO;2;1073;But Prager now knew me well enough to dash their hopes of obtaining any concession of that sort from me.
MusicBO;2;1177;my old friend Hermann Franck was then staying at Brighton, and had come up to London for a few days.
MusicBO;2;1239;The sole consolation I had was in the deep emotion of my new friends when I took leave of them.
MusicBO;2;1419;For years afterwards I never passed this beach on very frequent visits without receiving a friendly handshake or a greeting.
MusicBO;2;1551;By the beginning of December I had so far recovered as to be able to resume the composition of Siegfried.
MusicBO;2;1605;For this purpose I adopted the form of a letter to Marie Wittgenstein, which was published in Brendel's musical journal.
MusicBO;2;1741;such was my mode of life, and if it was disturbed, I was thrown into the deepest state of irritation.
MusicBO;2;1770;For at that moment, unfortunately, neither Zurich, nor my home, nor the company of my friends afforded me any relaxation.
MusicBO;2;1826;This was Herr Scudo, who, I found out afterwards, was the famous musical editor of the Revue des deux Mondes.
MusicBO;2;2098;Le Baruffe Chioggiote, the grotesque comedy that had appealed so strongly to Goethe in his day, at this very theatre.
MusicBO;2;2353;My main object was to discover my desired peaceful place of refuge in some small house remote from the thoroughfares.
MusicBO;2;2673;Interesting strangers sought me out, in the hope that Interesting strangers, too, might attain to equal fortune through knowing me.
MusicBO;2;2689;At no single interview did this man fail to press for the introduction of a ballet into the second act.
MusicBO;2;3032;Above all, I was besieged with advice as to how I might recover the lost ground at the subsequent performances.
MusicBO;2;3116;I went to lunch with him one morning, when Faust revealed to me the fact that Faust composed musical fantasies.
MusicBO;2;3228;The next day I hurried back to Karlsruhe, where my announcement was received by the Grand Duke with kindly acquiescence.
MusicBO;2;3623;At the same time I learned the true significance of the events which had taken place at the Hotel Metternich.
MusicBO;2;3756;I promised to visit her, and thus became acquainted with an idyllic home such as I had never met before.
MusicBO;2;3873;I informed him briefly of my indignation and of my decision to have nothing to do with Lohengrin in Karlsruhe.
MusicBO;2;3878;In my published Memoirs I have described more accurately the impressions I received on this occasion, more particularly of Schnorr.
MusicBO;2;3916;David, the Leipzig concert director, called on me with his young pupil, August Wilhelmj, the son of a Wiesbaden lawyer.
MusicBO;2;4244;In spite of all warnings to the contrary, I had fixed the contrary for the New Year's Day of 1863.
MusicBO;2;4278;To this the effect of my visit to the minister Schmerling immediately on my return to Vienna had certainly contributed.
MusicBO;2;4472;But I was soon in great trouble again, on account of Minna, who bitterly reproached me for everything I did.
MusicBO;2;4690;During my first stay in Vienna this man had shown himself a warmly devoted friend, always ready to help me.
MusicBO;2;4724;I wanted to have time to find what seemed suitable quarters in one of the places bordering on Lake Zurich.
MusicBO;2;79;I replied very fully, and eloquently pointed out to him the vital importance of this moment in his life.
MusicBO;2;111;The question now was to find him a sphere which would give him a suitable scope for his talents.
MusicBO;2;165;Probably he would have indulged less freely in these excesses, had I taken my art a little less seriously.
MusicBO;2;272;this article must also be remembered that almost all the newspapers of Europe are in the hands of Jews.
MusicBO;2;970;I also renounced by this means the vain wish to be honoured by an autograph letter from his hand.
MusicBO;2;1127;I felt much stimulated, however, on the two or three occasions when Sainton invited me to dine with Berlioz.
MusicBO;2;1554;I now lost touch entirely with this young friend, who in so many ways had endeared himself to me.
MusicBO;2;1559;It was now that the tortures inflicted upon me by noisy and musical neighbours began to increase in intensity.
MusicBO;2;1579;He now gave instructions that this piece of land must be acquired at any price from the unfortunate specialist.
MusicBO;2;1881;"As a matter of fact I never said a word; I hardly moved, but simply allowed her to depart."
MusicBO;2;2080;"He was the only person I saw regularly every day; otherwise I rigorously avoided any other society or acquaintance."
MusicBO;2;2100;There was little else that attracted my attention in the oppressed and degenerate life of the Venetian people, and
MusicBO;2;2190;Moreover, it now turned out that my further stay in Venice no longer depended wholly on my own will.
MusicBO;2;2310;I was completely terrified by his arrival, and was at a loss to know what to do with him.
MusicBO;2;2315;Wilhelm Baumgartner, my old Zurich acquaintance, came to spend a few weeks in Lucerne out of kindness to me.
MusicBO;2;2319;I went up Mount Pilatus with Drasecke, and again had to look after a companion who suffered from giddiness.
MusicBO;2;2628;This I had to outline for him, and when I had finished, the Emperor Napoleon exclaimed with satisfaction, 'Ah!
MusicBO;2;2723;It struck me as odd that hardly any of the leading singers of the Opera were suggested by him.
MusicBO;2;2751;I now saw the lady again for the first time since my stay in Paris with Liszt in 1853.
MusicBO;2;2795;I heard that on the occasion of a meeting between the German princes and the Emperor Napoleon in Baden
MusicBO;2;2815;There I first turned my steps, via Cologne, to Coblenz, where I expected to find Princess Augusta of Prussia.
MusicBO;2;3217;As my birthday fell just at the time of this return journey, I resolved to celebrate it at Zurich.
MusicBO;2;3410;Liszt had given me at Weimar a box of the most costly cigars—a present to him from Baron Sina.
MusicBO;2;3431;It had been quite a special coincidence that had brought him there on that day and at that time.
MusicBO;2;3763;These meetings were full of agreeable impressions, to which frequent walks in the beautiful park of Biebrich Castle contributed.
MusicBO;2;3769;I proceeded at once to continue the composition, intending to allow the remaining scenes to follow in due succession.
MusicBO;2;3775;At the back of his park stood a tiny castle of ancient appearance on the borders of a lake.
MusicBO;2;3993;All that we could make out was the furious jealousy of Herr von Guaita and Friederike's witty, scornful defence.
MusicBO;2;4051;(They were conducted by Herr Ignaz Lachner of Frankfort, a smart, sleek man, but a wretchedly bad, muddle-headed conductor.)
MusicBO;2;4572;At Karlsruhe I was at once surrounded by various friends, who had come there on hearing of my project.
MusicBO;2;4708;Otto Wesendonck refused point-blank, and I could not resist sending him a reply to prove the injustice of this.
MusicBO;2;4726;I had no difficulty in making my friend understand my situation, which I found her most willing to relieve.
MusicBO;2;96;It was impossible to keep him any longer in his position or to ask him to conduct again.
MusicBO;2;408;I was much pleased with the way in which Minna had arranged our new little flat in Zurich.
MusicBO;2;669;I had made arrangements that the performers should stay at Zurich a whole week from Sunday to Sunday.
MusicBO;2;701;Thereupon followed one of those delightful weeks, during which every hour of the day becomes a treasured memory.
MusicBO;2;783;I telegraphed to my wife to let her know my decision, and to have my study in readiness.
MusicBO;2;898;In consequence of these disappointments I suffered great worries and cares during the greater part of that year.
MusicBO;2;902;I had received an invitation from the 'Eidgenossische Musikgesellschaft' to conduct their musical festival at Sion that year.
MusicBO;2;986;Meanwhile, through the help of friends, I succeeded in bringing about a satisfactory change in my financial position.
MusicBO;2;1182;This was the unanimous explanation of my intentions which my old friend Hermann Franck had heard in Germany.
MusicBO;2;1213;I attended a performance of the Merry Wives there, which really amazed me by its correctness and precision.
MusicBO;2;1450;But before these ladies arrived, a most painful incident occurred between Liszt and Karl Ritter at my house.
MusicBO;2;1500;If I then called her a 'child,' I could not now properly describe her as a 'young woman.'
MusicBO;2;2135;Through it I lost some of my popular prejudices against the tyrannical mode of government in ancient Venice.
MusicBO;2;2878;The characteristic features of the system in Paris may be described simply as extreme frigidity and extraordinary accuracy.
MusicBO;2;2918;Unfortunately I caught a violent cold in the course of moving and took few precautions to check it.
MusicBO;2;3380;It was long after midnight when we reached Nuremberg, where we were obliged to halt for the night.
MusicBO;2;3423;—I had willingly accepted this offer, and now drove direct with my hand luggage to the house described.
MusicBO;2;3437;I realised, however, from information given me by my friend, that my path was beset with new difficulties.
MusicBO;2;3440;My situation was, as I now saw plainly, quite hopeless, for every one seemed to have deserted me.
MusicBO;2;3488;A musician named Winterberger was an old acquaintance, and I found him in a position I much envied.
MusicBO;2;3700;At last I decided to stay at the 'Europaischer Hof' at Biebrich, and continue my search from there.
MusicBO;2;3904;I returned there now, to be in time for Bulow's visit, of which I had already been informed.
MusicBO;2;4115;In response to this I received the startling and unexpected sum of fifteen hundred marks through Muller's instrumentality.
MusicBO;2;4175;She had also gone almost entirely bald, but nevertheless persisted in her great objection to wearing a wig.
MusicBO;2;4664;As Heinrich Porges and Gustav Schonaich sometimes joined us, we founded an intimate little circle and met regularly.
MusicBO;2;4728;I wanted to cater for myself, but had to yield to her request to take over that responsibility.
MusicBO;2;154;But I had to pay heavily for the exhausting toil expended on the conclusion of this work.
MusicBO;2;514;Fresh snow had fallen, which partially concealed the crevasses, and prevented one from recognising the dangerous spots.
MusicBO;2;752;With my extremely excitable nervous system, they were a source of more trouble than relief to me.
MusicBO;2;763;Finding nothing to detain me there more than a couple of days, I hurried on to Genoa.
MusicBO;2;899;I tried to counteract these by new work, and instead of writing out the score of Rheingold
MusicBO;2;1120;Berlioz, too, had been brought over to London, to conduct two of the New Philharmonic Society's concerts.
MusicBO;2;1163;I had to go once or twice to the Italian Opera at Covent Garden with his daughter.
MusicBO;2;1317;In the end I had to shrug my shoulders in silent acquiescence with these hopelessly unkind remarks,
MusicBO;2;1633;I had not made up my mind what name to give to my new place of refuge.
MusicBO;2;1896;Meantime, I avoided asking any questions as to what had taken place in regard to our neighbours.
MusicBO;2;1990;I almost felt inclined to make my final decision dependent on the effect of his expected visit.
MusicBO;2;2062;During my stay in Venice we met almost daily, and continued to be on very friendly terms.
MusicBO;2;2104;There I also met the whole staff of officers, and was treated by them with great respect.
MusicBO;2;2154;Consequently I realised that I could not count on the possibility of an early settlement in Germany.
MusicBO;2;2254;I repeated this visit, which was twice returned to me, once on the occasion of my birthday.
MusicBO;2;2682;I thus learned to appreciate the skill and talent of this young musician, which was simply amazing.
MusicBO;2;2696;This man Lindau was a native of Magdeburg, who had fled to escape the Prussian military service.
MusicBO;2;2730;I could think of no one but Niemann of Hanover, whose fame reached me from every quarter.
MusicBO;2;2741;As I was ever anxious, amid all my other discomforts, to find some relief from this burden
MusicBO;2;2745;This I did by way of guaranteeing him the repayment of the capital advanced for their publication.
MusicBO;2;2883;He insisted on considerable alterations in the text, so as to obtain a favourable medium for singing.
MusicBO;2;3020;Some of them were very quick to resent what they supposed to be my neglect of them.
MusicBO;2;3103;Thereupon the legal action taken on my behalf by Ollivier against Lindau also came to an end.
MusicBO;2;3502;I only visited him once, and did not have a particularly long talk with him even then.
MusicBO;2;3561;With the utmost distinctness I at once composed the principal part of the Overture in C major.
MusicBO;2;3669;He had spoken to me about a pretty estate there belonging to the young Baron von Hornstein.
MusicBO;2;3784;He it was who had introduced me to another friend, a practised musician, Dr. Schuler from Wiesbaden.
MusicBO;2;3911;Frau Dustmann also, who had a special engagement for a performance at Wiesbaden, paid me a visit.
MusicBO;2;3976;I could not fail to be satisfied with the friendly reception accorded to me by my patrons.
MusicBO;2;4042;I therefore decided at all costs to keep on the house at Biebrich, which I really liked.
MusicBO;2;4284;For these I relied on a concert which Heinrich Porges had already arranged for me in Prague.
MusicBO;2;4319;Not far from the capital itself the empty seats in our carriage were filled by several people,
MusicBO;2;4397;The orchestra consisted of the hundred musicians who provided the Imperial household with Italian opera and ballet.
MusicBO;2;4438;I gratefully answered her in the same manner, and said that I now knew what to do.
MusicBO;2;4714;I stayed at the 'Bayerischer Hof' and took a few walks through the city at my leisure.
MusicBO;2;4725;Dr. Wille himself was not there, as Dr. Wille had gone to Constantinople on a pleasure trip.
MusicBO;2;4754;But I was also, as will be seen, moved to carry out this change by other motives.
MusicBO;2;19;Unfortunately, there was one perpetual source of quarrel, arising from my wife's behaviour towards poor Nathalie.
MusicBO;2;63;Karl knew nothing whatever about rhythmic precision or tempo, the very essentials of a conductor's career.
MusicBO;2;71;I had met his father at Zurich in the previous year just after his second marriage.
MusicBO;2;156;As it had already completely recovered from several similar attacks, I did not feel very anxious.
MusicBO;2;576;On reaching home I found announcements of a new and quite different turn in my destiny.
MusicBO;2;688;The sensation produced by these evening concerts spread through the whole of Switzerland in ever-widening circles.
MusicBO;2;834;I presume that our feelings on this occasion must have differed as much as our reminiscences.
MusicBO;2;967;Just then I was prompted to send the venerated philosopher a copy of my Nibelungen poem.
MusicBO;2;1087;This was on the occasion of the Rhenish Musical Festival, which was held at that time.
MusicBO;2;1224;This accounts for the fact that an oratorio attracts the public far more than an opera.
MusicBO;2;1531;We watched each other over our work with a closeness and sympathy that was genuinely instructive.
MusicBO;2;1810;I was no less delighted by my conversation with Ollivier regarding his political views and position.
MusicBO;2;1824;The rest of the day was spent very pleasantly in the bosom of the Herold family.
MusicBO;2;1855;I now heard nothing about all these performances except that they were yielding very little money.
MusicBO;2;1967;I quite believed, however, that Niemann's voice must be on a par with his imposing personality.
MusicBO;2;2021;We did not talk much on the way, but gave ourselves up silently to our impressions.
MusicBO;2;2066;Except for some foolish behaviour on his part I had not noticed anything particular about him.
MusicBO;2;2199;Soon, however, everything began to assume a more serious aspect, and to look gloomy and depressing.
MusicBO;2;2320;To celebrate his departure I invited him to take an excursion to Brunnen and the Grutli.
MusicBO;2;2361;I took this on a three-years' agreement at a rent of four thousand francs a year.
MusicBO;2;2474;I was able to go and meet her at the station on the 17th of November.
MusicBO;2;2781;the singer Niemann was engaged for eight months at a monthly salary of ten thousand francs.
MusicBO;2;2854;This man was still young and extraordinarily attractive, with something friendly and open in his manner.
MusicBO;2;2871;We had first of all to join forces in promoting an entirely new piece of work.
MusicBO;2;3328;This bargain set the standard of my relation to her for the rest of her life.
MusicBO;2;3397;Here Cosima met us, and took us to the rooms that had been prepared for us.
MusicBO;2;3420;I proposed to accept the hospitality of Kolatschek, with whom I had been friendly in Switzerland.
MusicBO;2;3721;From this excursion I had again to return home through the floating ice on the Rhine.
MusicBO;2;3876;A great longing at last filled me to make the acquaintance of Schnorr and his achievements.
MusicBO;2;3957;Cosima was the only one who managed to keep in a good temper throughout the proceedings.
MusicBO;2;4153;I returned in haste to Biebrich, where I had to get my household affairs into order.
MusicBO;2;4292;Her admiration was now intensified, and for many years afterwards she remained tenderly attached to me.
MusicBO;2;4636;After all my previous experiences I was truly astonished and contented, and it was with pleasure
MusicBO;2;4660;Greatly cheered by the impressions of this meeting I returned to Vienna on the 9th December.
MusicBO;2;78;This was one of the occasions when my easily excited indignation roused me to activity.
MusicBO;2;232;On the other hand, however, I felt very much tempted to entertain the Weimar proposal.
MusicBO;2;265;I thereupon felt impelled to contribute an epoch-making article to his paper on these lines.
MusicBO;2;275;This erelong developed into a savage persecution which aimed at nothing less than his ruin.
MusicBO;2;461;, they thought it would be desirable to include me in their circle of friends.
MusicBO;2;711;I even thought of beginning to compose again after the long interval that had elapsed.
MusicBO;2;782;I decided to return to Zurich immediately, and begin the composition of my great poem.
MusicBO;2;889;During the first months of the new year I also conducted a few orchestral concerts.
MusicBO;2;1009;At this time I had an extraordinary application, such as I have never received again.
MusicBO;2;1022;I have a particularly vivid recollection of the singer who played Elizabeth on that occasion.
MusicBO;2;1038;Prager also took me to see his friend Sainton, the leader of the London orchestra.
MusicBO;2;1085;The leading papers still announced, as before, that every concert I conducted was a fiasco.
MusicBO;2;1106;Prager was often present, and we frequently took an evening stroll through the foggy streets.
MusicBO;2;1188;Only a few months later, after my return home, I heard of his mysterious death.
MusicBO;2;1296;I was therefore surprised to find him a person of extraordinarily shy and awkward demeanour.
MusicBO;2;1457;If we are not prepared to admit this, what do we prove ourselves to be?
MusicBO;2;1564;My own plans, elaborated with a deceptive skill, had been already submitted to an architect.
MusicBO;2;1790;It was Herr Hasselmann, a native of Strasburg, and apparently a very good-natured, amiable fellow.
MusicBO;2;1798;I looked upon this event as a malicious stroke of fate, aimed at me personally.
MusicBO;2;1957;and then, with great conscientiousness and zeal, and paid special attention to all my wishes.
MusicBO;2;2058;I had at first explained to him that owing to the state of my health
MusicBO;2;2159;My negotiations with Eckert, who was director at that time, quickly led to satisfactory results.
MusicBO;2;2235;I could make myself quite comfortable here in the larger rooms at a moderate price.
MusicBO;2;2237;For this purpose I found a careful woman well suited to look after my comfort.
MusicBO;2;2294;On this animal I rode every morning as long as this animal would carry me.
MusicBO;2;2334;At last I had to bestir myself to come to a decision about my wife.
MusicBO;2;2758;I improvised a special performance of the second act of my Tristan, in which Mme.
MusicBO;2;2813;Life also had become quieter, as is usually the case at this season in Paris.
MusicBO;2;2911;Under these circumstances the proprietor had no objection to make to my leaving the house.
MusicBO;2;3066;Morelli found himself strangely perplexed when Morelli had to weather the onslaught of the hooligans.
MusicBO;2;3075;As the vocalists showed a courageous determination to encounter fresh onslaughts, I could not protest.
MusicBO;2;3155;With this disappointing experience M. Erlanger now withdrew from all further participation in my fate.
MusicBO;2;3213;They both raved about the recently published pianoforte arrangement of Tristan, which Bulow had prepared.
MusicBO;2;3472;I was reminded of the morning in the tavern with the landlord Homo in Montmorency.
MusicBO;2;3547;I was at last obliged to acknowledge that my affairs were in a bad way.
MusicBO;2;3708;Unfortunately my good resolutions did not last long, as the old scenes were soon renewed.
MusicBO;2;3857;She said that Herr von Guaita was like an anxious, almost hypersensitive father to her.
MusicBO;2;3962;One little adventure we had at the gaming-table at Wiesbaden still lingers in my memory.
MusicBO;2;4046;Here again I went through the same experience as I had so often done before.
MusicBO;2;4072;I should probably have raised a protest against carrying out this programme in its entirety
MusicBO;2;4306;I entered a long room, at one end of which Bulow was giving a music-lesson.
MusicBO;2;4537;In accordance with his own desire, I very soon afterwards lost sight of him altogether.
MusicBO;2;4637;I returned the gallant Prince my heartfelt thanks with all the eloquence at my command.
MusicBO;2;4652;But the results of my meeting with Henriette von Bissing in Breslau were very different.
MusicBO;2;4789;On the same day I had received the most urgent warnings against returning to Vienna.
MusicBO;2;49;I had never had an opportunity of judging of his gifts in this line.
MusicBO;2;89;At first we had to console him, and stimulate his confidence by our cheerfulness.
MusicBO;2;117;, Karl Ritter preferred for the present to stay in seclusion at St. Gall.
MusicBO;2;137;However, Bulow caused quite a sensation, and I myself was astounded at his execution.
MusicBO;2;139;I frequently had occasion to admire his masterly skill both as conductor and accompanist.
MusicBO;2;259;In this he showed the originality of his ideas about Mozart's and Beethoven's methods,
MusicBO;2;293;I went by a pleasant detour through the Toggenburg, travelling on foot as usual.
MusicBO;2;302;It was my first experience also of travelling over an extensive snow-field in summer.
MusicBO;2;530;I shall never forget my impressions of my journey through the continually descending valley.
MusicBO;2;577;These consisted of inquiries and commissions from various German theatres anxious to produce Tannhauser.
MusicBO;2;731;—I decided first of all to go to St. Moritz Bad in the Engadine.
MusicBO;2;735;We were obliged to pass the time in reading at a most uncomfortable inn.
MusicBO;2;1243;Our project suffered a brief delay through the fatal illness of my dog Peps.
MusicBO;2;1275;What pained me most was the frequent interruption of my work on this account.
MusicBO;2;1515;the Princess gave me and my wife a room next her own private apartment.
MusicBO;2;1526;The performance turned out to be a really fine one, and full of spirit.
MusicBO;2;1889;I realised the position clearly when I afterwards met my wife looking wonderfully cheerful.
MusicBO;2;2029;I certainly felt I was taking part in a funeral procession during a pestilence.
MusicBO;2;2031;Next came the long sail through the twists and turns of the Grand Canal.
MusicBO;2;2148;I really went so far as to write to him cordially and in detail.
MusicBO;2;2160;All this happened during the course of the winter and early spring of 1859.
MusicBO;2;2183;It seemed as if this was not destined to be the case in Venice.
MusicBO;2;2186;Its climate about this time of the year did not commend itself to me.
MusicBO;2;2249;A few days after my arrival I had already visited the Wesendoncks in Zurich.
MusicBO;2;2962;I asked for unheard-of combinations quite different from those generally employed in the ballet.
MusicBO;2;3125;I now came into touch with energetic protagonists of my cause at every turn.
MusicBO;2;3152;It also seemed possible that the requisite capitalists would be found for his enterprise.
MusicBO;2;3275;In our childless life together the influence of domestic pets had been very important.
MusicBO;2;3714;I deliberated with considerable hesitation as to what I should do in this matter.
MusicBO;2;3774;But I had an ulterior motive in trying to prepossess him in my favour.
MusicBO;2;3793;I had a similar experience with a property in Rheingau belonging to Count Schonborn.
MusicBO;2;3941;We remained that night in Rolandseck, and next morning we went up the Drachenfels.
MusicBO;2;4049;Yet I suppose Friederike Meyer was the only one who completely realised these effects.
MusicBO;2;4193;Dr. Hanslick became uncompromisingly hostile, with results that were obvious to us at once.
MusicBO;2;4210;Moreover, Frau Dustmann's absurd behaviour disgusted me on my frequent attendance at the rehearsals.
MusicBO;2;4213;For all the practical details of the performance Tausig now proved himself particularly useful.
MusicBO;2;4401;whose Russian fur caps had so scared me on my way to St. Petersburg.
MusicBO;2;4555;, I was driven to take up the study of Dunker's Geschichte des Alterthums.
MusicBO;2;4585;Seated by my old acquaintance, I was now introduced to the Russian poet Turgenieff.
MusicBO;2;31;However, when one day I reminded him that in coming hack to Zurich
MusicBO;2;64;I felt completely nonplussed and was absolutely at a loss what to say.
MusicBO;2;143;On an occasion like this I also read aloud extracts from my manuscripts.
MusicBO;2;161;Sulzer was without a doubt the worthiest and most important of these friends.
MusicBO;2;354;As a matter of fact, this was the last time we ever met.
MusicBO;2;450;I introduced this change very gradually and with the co-operation of my friends.
MusicBO;2;515;The guide, of course, had to precede me here, to examine the path.
MusicBO;2;574;We therefore saw ourselves forced to hasten on our journey home via Geneva.
MusicBO;2;639;The news of his death took place on the 3rd of January, 1853.
MusicBO;2;746;I had to cover the distance nearly twice over, as, to my astonishment
MusicBO;2;808;I stole away and found him in bed suffering from a splitting headache.
MusicBO;2;992;The Zurich Musical Society now again enlisted my interest for their winter concerts.
MusicBO;2;1030;Arriving in London on 2nd March I first went to see Ferdinand Prager.
MusicBO;2;1211;I was greatly astonished by many audacities in his acting on this occasion.
MusicBO;2;1274;It was obviously the result of the ill effects of the London climate.
MusicBO;2;1406;I could never make out whether this was the result of their having
MusicBO;2;1453;At table the conversation turned on the Emperor of the French, Louis Napoleon,
MusicBO;2;1684;I invited all the friends in our circle, including Semper and Herwegh, and
MusicBO;2;1775;I felt a growing presentiment that I was going away never to return.
MusicBO;2;1833;whose acquaintance was at that time busy composing a grand opera, Die Trojaner.
MusicBO;2;2044;, I felt that I should find out what cold meant in Venice.
MusicBO;2;2181;It was now necessary to make new decisions for my plan of life.
MusicBO;2;2204;I could not but grudge the former race their victory over the latter.
MusicBO;2;2418;With this object in view I decided to arrange a few important concerts.
MusicBO;2;2881;On the other hand, he proved to me by the most punctilious solicitude
MusicBO;2;2947;Certainly I now obtained a clearer insight into the actual state of affairs.
MusicBO;2;2968;Such was the substance of what my trusty friend Truinet conveyed to me.
MusicBO;2;2974;He had been informed that there was a conspiracy to ruin my work.
MusicBO;2;3049;The impression made by this scene had a disastrous effect upon my friends.
MusicBO;2;3262;It was now settled that we must at all costs leave Paris soon.
MusicBO;2;3444;I wrote him a beseeching letter, urging him to consider my necessitous condition.
MusicBO;2;3545;First I turned to Tichatschek in Dresden, but obtained no promise from him.
MusicBO;2;3779;I heard that a family would enter into possession, armed with a piano.
MusicBO;2;3801;declared the sick lady was afraid the sick lady had caught scarlet fever.
MusicBO;2;4232;I had only to fall back on amateurs for the three Rhine maidens.
MusicBO;2;4352;Meanwhile my patrons had to be content with hearing me read the Meistersinger.
MusicBO;2;4497;Fritz, the younger brother of Heinrich Porges, had also begun to visit me.
MusicBO;2;5;I arrived early in the morning and found Minna still in bed.
MusicBO;2;385;At this time symptoms of a possible improvement in my position appeared.
MusicBO;2;667;I had to undertake to engage an orchestra to suit my requirements.
MusicBO;2;673;I had the joy of seeing all my directions accurately carried out.
MusicBO;2;1176;A visit from my old friend Hermann Franck was a pleasant surprise.
MusicBO;2;1208;I found the performances at the Olympic Theatre less simple and innocent.
MusicBO;2;1272;But I met with a new vexation when colder weather set in.
MusicBO;2;2185;I did not think I dared spend the hot weather in Venice.
MusicBO;2;2290;I tried to overcome my gastric troubles by using (among other things)
MusicBO;2;2335;We had now been apart from each other for a whole year.
MusicBO;2;2372;I prevailed upon Carvalho to visit me to talk the matter over.
MusicBO;2;2796;she used her influence on my behalf with the King of Saxony.
MusicBO;2;3234;Meanwhile Minna found an opportunity for exhibiting her talents as a housewife.
MusicBO;2;3366;But I was not to get off without any ovation at all.
MusicBO;2;3663;the lady was en desolation at being obliged to deny my wish.
MusicBO;2;3837;When the disturbance had somewhat subsided, I went to bed again, and
MusicBO;2;3949;The story was not completed for me until a long time afterwards.
MusicBO;2;3991;In the end the mysterious Herr von Guaita also joined us there.
MusicBO;2;4160;Her situation in Frankfort seemed to have grown more and more difficult.
MusicBO;2;4230;We had now come to the point of rehearsing for the concert.
MusicBO;2;4312;In Konigsburg I had to wait half a day and a night.
MusicBO;2;4631;Being both intelligent and witty, she at once became my favourite companion.
MusicBO;2;4634;She promised to come to Breslau, when I gave my concert there.
MusicBO;3;140;That meant to throw yourself into the work body and soul, to sacrifice body and soul, to press and exert every fibre of the body, every faculty of the soul, towards the one aim of not only producing your friend's work, but of producing it splendidly and to his advantage.
MusicBO;3;2121;"The written word is, I fear, insufficient for my intention; but if I could read The written word to you viva voce, indicating how I want to have The written word interpreted, I should be quite satisfied as to the desired impression of my poem upon you."
MusicBO;3;204;However that may be, I feel too silly today to thank your esteemed friend otherwise than through your medium, through your mouth, and therefore I pray you with all my power to express my gratitude to her as fervently, as joyfully, as you are able.
MusicBO;3;2679;Next winter you shall have news of our performance at Weymar, for we must not delay it any longer, and hope that it will be a success on the part of the artists, for as to the work itself there can be no question.
MusicBO;3;4979;"I know that I shall have another letter from you soon, because you have something to relate to me; so I am proud, and rely upon another letter, and keep my peace, telling you thereby that I love you sincerely with all my heart."
MusicBO;3;1563;I foresee the difficulties I shall have to encounter in publishing through the Paris press an article so extensive and so sincerely in praise of a German opera by a German composer, in whose success no one has an interest, rather the reverse.
MusicBO;3;2936;"One thing has recently calmed my anxiety: I have written tolerably comprehensive instructions for the performance of ""Tannhauser"", and have had them printed as a pamphlet and sent a sufficient number of copies to the theatres which had bought the score."
MusicBO;3;1373;"This will probably be the case with the performance of ""Lohengrin"" in Weimar, which only now that I have been able to ask about many difficult details I can appreciate in its excellence and perfection as regards the musical portion."
MusicBO;3;1927;"This is a relation of the most perfect dishonesty; neither party is sincere towards the other; one and the other assume the appearance of affection, and both make use of each other as long as their mutual interest requires it."
MusicBO;3;3662;"Moreover, I cannot express to you how my heart rejoices at the thought that I might look on from a hidden corner while you instilled my work into the Berliners; this satisfaction to my feelings I must live to see!"
MusicBO;3;4469;As you probably do not read similar newspapers, I tell you of the fact, and ask you to take account of similar newspapers in your intercourse with Kohler, whom you should keep in kindly remembrance as one of the loyal.
MusicBO;3;1514;As in this book I intend to explain my view of the essence of the musical drama, I can find nothing more annoying than to see the most contradictory opinions of me spread amongst the public by witty litterateurs.
MusicBO;3;4511;I am in a miserable condition, and have great difficulty in persuading myself that it must go on like this, and that it would not really be more moral to put an end to this disgraceful kind of life.
MusicBO;3;3526;"Our orchestra is now on a good footing; and as soon as the five or six new engagements which I have proposed have been made, Our orchestra may boast of being one of the most excellent in Germany."
MusicBO;3;347;"In Paris without a home, or—which is the same—peace of heart, I can do no work; I must find a new place where I am at home and can make up my mind to remain at home."
MusicBO;3;1934;without realizing and confessing my absolute antagonism to Meyerbeer, and to this I am driven with genuine desperation when I meet with the erroneous opinion even amongst my friends that I have anything in common with Meyerbeer.
MusicBO;3;195;I am amongst those most desirous of seeing you, sir, and of repeating from mouth to mouth the expression of the admiring and devoted sentiments of which I ask you to be a thousand times assured.
MusicBO;3;227;From Coburg I could not start for Lichtenfels till early on Saturday, but fortunately I got through everywhere without notice, at Lindau only, where I arrived at midnight, they asked for my passport at the gate.
MusicBO;3;143;If I have judged your beautiful action rightly, if I have understood you, I hope you will understand me too when, in words as brief and precise as was your action, I say to you,
MusicBO;3;1565;If in the meantime you think my article worthy of publication in Germany, I repeat the request already made that you undertake to translate my article freely, and improve my article by completing my article.
MusicBO;3;4044;"Before long I may send you a little article about the ""Flying Dutchman""; and if you approve of a little article about the ""Flying Dutchman"", a little article about the ""Flying Dutchman"" shall be published."
MusicBO;3;1428;"But before all you must be acquainted with my article, and tell me very frankly whether or not you would like to have a very long article of mine about ""Lohengrin published in Germany."
MusicBO;3;4005;It was equally clear that you were unable to accept the proposal for the Konigsstadt Theatre with the Leipzig troupe, and I am only annoyed at their impudence in offering you such a thing.
MusicBO;3;997;I have convictions which perhaps you will never share, but which you will not think it necessary to combat when I tell you that they in no manner interfere with my artistic activity.
MusicBO;3;3825;The forms in which we endeavour to gain comfort in our miserable circumstances depend wholly upon our nature, our wants, the character of our culture and of our more or less artistic sensations.
MusicBO;3;4504;It cannot possibly suit me to write the same thing over and over again on the chance of being at last understood, besides which I should probably only puzzle people worse and worse.
MusicBO;3;882;I assume, however, that all possible means will be readily placed at your disposal, and also that you will succeed in conquering every difficulty if you are fully determined to do so.
MusicBO;3;1150;At this moment, dearest friend, after having closed the letter already, I begin to feel a doubt whether you have received my last letter, which I sent you about eighteen days ago.
MusicBO;3;1733;I was quite confounded, and thought that some misapprehension of an expression in one of my letters might have led you and B. after you to a completely erroneous opinion about me.
MusicBO;3;2406;To Herr von Zigesar also I ask you to express my most cordial thanks for the very kind manner in which Herr von Zigesar has received and replied to my last communication.
MusicBO;3;2472;One thought that she not only desired to win the throne of Brabant, but was also jealous of Frederick and of the charms of her from whom she had torn him away.
MusicBO;3;2686;"Send them to me soon; we have here a very clever young scenepainter and engineer, Herr Handel, late of the Hamburg theatre, who will take every care to comply with your demands."
MusicBO;3;2887;But what do you mean by occupying yourself with the bad jokes which have been circulating in a few newspapers, and by even accusing me of having been the cause of them?
MusicBO;3;4734;"Here the tempo is to be considerably slower even than at the first entry of the D major; the impression must be one of solemn emotion, or else the intention is lost."
MusicBO;3;4796;"With the ""Flying Dutchman"" I left the orchestra for a time at the beginning of last March, and with the same work I resume my connection with the theatre for this season."
MusicBO;3;170;"I shall send you by post the article that appeared in our Gemeindeblatt, where is also printed the prologue of Schober, who had the sense to turn ""Tannhauser"" to good account."
MusicBO;3;392;My position is all the more painful because I can take no steps to free myself from the suspicion of such sentiments without incurring the worse suspicion of meanness and cowardice.
MusicBO;3;722;In consequence of the good opinion which you kindly express of my talent as a composer, I am going to ask you a favour if the idea meets with your approval.
MusicBO;3;825;"In my life some decisive events have happened; the last shackles have fallen that tied me to a world in which I must have perished soon, not only mentally, but physically."
MusicBO;3;1648;I consented, and reserved to myself the right of revising the translation of your article afterwards, so as to set forth less my praise than the animation of your original style.
MusicBO;3;2316;the R. family has had the effect that for that time and for the rest of my life I may attend to my artistic creations quietly and undisturbed by material cares.
MusicBO;3;2351;As I told you before, I can now send you this poem willingly and without fear, for you are no longer required to glance from this poem anxiously towards your public.
MusicBO;3;2541;Her intelligent remarks on the character of Ortrud attracted me especially, as well as the comparison she makes between the efforts of the previous and the actual representative of that part.
MusicBO;3;2942;This eternal communication by letter and in print is terrible to me, especially when it is about things the significance of which has for a long time lain far behind me.
MusicBO;3;3588;BEST OF FRIENDS, Please let me have two words to say whether you have received a parcel, sent from here on February 11th, and containing several copies of my new poem,
MusicBO;3;4871;"For that purpose I may first mention the step which I have fixed upon taking in order to make the copyright of ""Lohengrin"" much more valuable than otherwise it would be—"
MusicBO;3;518;"Restore her to me; by doing so you will give me all you can wish for me, and, believe me, for that I shall be grateful to you, yea grateful!"
MusicBO;3;810;I shortly expect M. Ernst on his return from London, and M. Ernst will give me some details as to the actual situation and the personnel of the London theatres.
MusicBO;3;925;My question has become more complicated than I thought, as complicated, indeed, as is the demand on Herr von Zigesar to pay me five hundred francs for a mere arrangement.
MusicBO;3;1660;Let this suffice: I feel more than fully rewarded for my efforts, my sacrifices, and my artistic struggles by recognizing the impression I have made upon you of all others.
MusicBO;3;1984;I am most curious to know your views and practical proposals with regard to theatrical matters, and I shall be most ready to adopt your ideas as far as possible.
MusicBO;3;2086;The contact with a sympathetic, noble female nature is to me an infinitely joyful feeling, and that feeling I should like to gain as a blessing for my impending work.
MusicBO;3;2344;Nevertheless this agreement has still another meaning, which appears all the more serious at this moment because Zigesar has, temporarily at least, a successor in the management of the theatre.
MusicBO;3;2502;If I now turn to my great work, I now turn to my great work is done for the purpose of seeking salvation from my misery, forgetfulness of my life.
MusicBO;3;4693;Today my rehearsals begin here, and I shall again have to go to Darmstadt and Mannheim to have separate rehearsals, till we return here next Saturday for the general rehearsals.
MusicBO;3;804;In actual circumstances it is almost impossible for you to think of a speedy return to Germany where, moreover, you would find nothing but disagreeable things, envy, and enmity.
MusicBO;3;858;"Of my immediate past I only say that my intended journey to Greece has come to nothing; there were too many impediments, which I found it impossible to overcome."
MusicBO;3;978;You, on your part, might write to him to the same effect, which would be a good beginning of the plan which I shall submit to your ultimate decision.
MusicBO;3;1101;"Whenever I have news of Dear friend, I am filled with new desire to commence some large artistic work; for literary work I have no longer any great inclination."
MusicBO;3;1213;Owing to the deplorable fact that at our German theatres scarcely anything but operas translated from a foreign language is given, our dramatic singers have been most thoroughly demoralized.
MusicBO;3;1832;"If I am to undertake an important artistic task, my immediate future—say for the current year, at least—must be secured; otherwise I shall lack the necessary cheerfulness and collectedness."
MusicBO;3;2192;I happen to possess them, and send them to you, although I do not quite see of what use some numbers of the Deutsche Monatsschrift can be to you.
MusicBO;3;2272;I found that I should have to prepare it by another drama, and therefore took up the long-cherished idea of making the young Siegfried the subject of a poem.
MusicBO;3;2844;Herewith I send you a bill for one hundred thalers, and cordially wish you good luck and a good mood, fine weather externally and internally, for your Alpine trip.
MusicBO;3;2930;But I do not wish to complain, only to explain to you why it is that today I must limit my communication to stating briefly what is absolutely necessary.
MusicBO;3;3488;To theatres like those of Munich and others I should have to refuse them, because the conductors there would have nothing better to do than to ruin me thoroughly.
MusicBO;3;4217;I saw her first in her dressing-room at the theatre, where his wife had kindly invited me to visit her for a quarter of an hour after the concert.
MusicBO;3;4848;"I propose to sell to the Hartels the copyright of the score of ""Lohengrin,"" including the right of selling it to theatrical managers, with the following exceptions only:— 1."
MusicBO;3;475;I am wholly made of sentiment, and could never understand, in the face of such a reproach, why I felt no pangs of conscience at this supposed ingratitude.
MusicBO;3;713;Kindly write on this subject to your niece, who is engaged for the whole winter at Hamburg, and ask her to come to our assistance on this occasion.
MusicBO;3;1000;Remember that I used to call you happy in your particular art, because you were an immediate artist, actually present, and appealing to the senses at every moment.
MusicBO;3;2212;I send you today the letter of M. Philipront, of Brussels, and the draft of my answer, by which you can regulate your subsequent correspondence with those gentlemen.
MusicBO;3;2336;For my sake I care no longer about it, for I have quite made up my mind as to it, but I care about it for your sake.
MusicBO;3;2586;This much I may add: that the motives which made me select this opera proved to be right and favourable to the further progress of my work here.
MusicBO;3;2822;I want to go to the Alps, and should like at least to have a taste of the frontier of Italy, and to make a short sojourn there.
MusicBO;3;4153;Apropos, neither of the two persons to whom I have hitherto talked about your hat was inclined to believe in your wholly unpolitical position and mode of feeling.
MusicBO;3;4376;Napoleon wrote to me once or twice before, and, between ourselves, I have heard several things about him which make me think that his character is not oversolid.
MusicBO;3;4701;You know that my whole soul is devoted to you, because I love you sincerely, and that I always try to serve you as well as I can.
MusicBO;3;4840;This is the first day I break into in order, if possible, to get rid once for all of this fear which follows me like a treacherous spectre.
MusicBO;3;256;My memorials of it are so numerous that I cannot put my hand in my pocket without being reminded of the thoughtfulness and sympathy of friend Wolff.
MusicBO;3;544;"Do you not think it advisable to add to ""Tannhauser"" a dedication (post scriptum) to the Lord of Wartburg, H.R.H. Carl Alexander, Hereditary Grand Duke of SaxeWeymar-Eisenach?"
MusicBO;3;935;I hope that so far I have not been wanting in these two essential conditions, and I do not mean to depart from them for the future.
MusicBO;3;1190;You may be quite assured of the fate of the masterpiece in Weymar, which is, no doubt, a little surprised at being able to produce such things.
MusicBO;3;1742;"I have not yet a publisher; and as I must take care to get a little money for it, I am a little anxious about the matter."
MusicBO;3;2334;I see the stupidity, the narrow-mindedness, the vulgarity, and the empty vanity of jealous courtiers, who are only too sadly justified in envying the success of genius.
MusicBO;3;2404;The full and unconditional approbation with which you receive my new plan is the best proof to my mind that I have hit upon the right thing.
MusicBO;3;2412;One thing I must ask you to do for me: send me your medallion, so that I may give your medallion to myself as a Christmas present.
MusicBO;3;2479;"As to myself, I cannot say which of these two conceptions produces the greater impression; the second has certainly something more sombre, more inexorable, about the second."
MusicBO;3;2496;I tell you this for the sake of truth, and without accompanying my complaint by wishes which, as no one knows better than I, must remain unfulfilled.
MusicBO;3;2885;Accept my most cordial, most fervent thanks in return, and be convinced that it will be the task of my life to be worthy of your friendship.
MusicBO;3;3140;"It is true that you occurred to me at once as my only guarantee, but I had first to secure your consent to undertake ""Tannhauser"" in Berlin."
MusicBO;3;4043;"The poetic indications which I read in the programme, especially those of the introduction to ""Lohengrin"" and the overture of the ""Flying Dutchman,"" interested me very much."
MusicBO;3;620;This unrest I have found in your compositions, even as you must have found Unrest in what we do too often in mine without better cause.
MusicBO;3;1331;I feel bound to add to the expression of my gratitude for your kind feeling my opinion as to how our mutual wishes might be realized.
MusicBO;3;1597;I shall say something more about the translation when I send the translation to you, which, as I mentioned before, will be in a few days.
MusicBO;3;1602;I look upon this final resumption of my artistic plans to which I now shall turn as one of the most decisive moments in my life.
MusicBO;3;1975;Should you not be inclined to publish your letter in its actual form of a letter to me in some newspaper which is open to you?
MusicBO;3;2289;I am compelled therefore to communicate my entire myth in its deepest and widest significance with the greatest artistic precision, so as to be fully understood.
MusicBO;3;2310;The performance of my Nibelung dramas will have to take place at a great festival, to be arranged perhaps especially for the purpose of this performance.
MusicBO;3;2328;I see with perfect clearness, and I call you openly the creator of my actual position, which may perhaps lead to great things in the future.
MusicBO;3;2786;Your score of the Flying Dutchman you can send to Uhlig, who possesses a newly revised score, and will arrange yours in strict accordance with it.
MusicBO;3;3790;If you write to him in the sense indicated in my letter to you from Leipzig, we shall soon get to the bottom of the matter.
MusicBO;3;3971;"All had brought their best instruments; and in the acoustical orchestra, constructed according to my indication, the tone of the instruments was most bright and beautiful."
MusicBO;3;4923;There is also some talk of a musical festival under Berlioz's direction at Brunswick next summer, where his Requiem and Te Deum are to be performed.
MusicBO;3;188;"Allow me, dear sir, to add another voice to the chorus of admiration which sings ""Gloria"" to the author of the double poem of ""Tannhauser."
MusicBO;3;215;I must also beg to convey my great and deeply felt gratitude to the artists who have deserved well of me by their successful zeal.
MusicBO;3;244;As yet I have not shown it to any artist, and therefore have not been able to learn from any one what impression it produces.
MusicBO;3;793;I should be too glad to be of any service to you, and am thankful to you for showing me the way to do it.
MusicBO;3;952;To speak truth, I should not be allowed to put so extraordinary a. work on the stage in the ordinary course of the theatrical season.
MusicBO;3;1075;I believe I am not mistaken as to your wishes and intentions, but should still prefer to have conviction in figures as to this matter.
MusicBO;3;1590;I return herewith the French original, and in a few days I shall send the translation, which by then will have received its proper form.
MusicBO;3;2931;Do not be angry with me for not writing with that joyful expansion which is intended to make up for the impossibility of personal intercourse.
MusicBO;3;3049;My nerves are not in the best condition, but I have begun again to work at my poem for an hour or so every day.
MusicBO;3;4052;This of course determines me not to expect that you should go to the watering-place in the Grisons with me for a few days only.
MusicBO;3;4683;I have at last hit upon a way of settling your passport affair which will make it unnecessary for me to have your passport here.
MusicBO;3;51;From several other causes the matter begins to look very alarming to me, and I ask myself secretly what is to become of me.
MusicBO;3;546;For the present you must expect no special donation in return, but the sympathy of the prince for your masterpiece fully justifies this attention.
MusicBO;3;2278;It was for that reason that I wrote the long preface to my three earlier operatic poems, of which mention has already been made.
MusicBO;3;2383;I hope that as soon as his painful disease of the eyes will allow him Zigesar will resume the management, probably by next spring.
MusicBO;3;2484;But one must have a high-toned and delicate soul to understand the infinite tenderness of his soul, which so few can feel or divine.
MusicBO;3;2688;If you would rather have this small sum at once, I will remit you would rather have this small sum at once by return.
MusicBO;3;2689;I have asked B. to tell you of the crime committed by me during the visit of his Majesty the Emperor of Russia. 
MusicBO;3;2893;"Do not therefore hesitate on your account or on my account to publish the ""Nibelung"" tetralogy as soon as the ""Nibelung"" tetralogy is finished."
MusicBO;3;3077;"I am very glad you have published that pamphlet, and advise you strongly to do the same thing for ""Lohengrin"" and the ""Flying Dutchman."
MusicBO;3;3780;In spite of all, I hope to find you in a good mental and physical condition when I visit you at the end of
MusicBO;3;3900;"Oh, and how much you have made of me; it has been indescribably beautiful for me to observe you during that space of time."
MusicBO;3;4378;A few days ago I received a letter from Berlioz, in answer to my last, in which I had said several things about you.
MusicBO;3;4387;As to the few lines of which you speak, I have never read them, and therefore feel not the slightest resentment on their account.
MusicBO;3;4522;"In the ""Carlsruhe Gazette"" it was announced that the Musical Festival had been postponed till October; will our meeting have to be postponed too?"
MusicBO;3;4686;Tell him that you intend to start for Paris on October 5th at the latest, and that we two are to meet at Basle.
MusicBO;3;4788;"The divine point of the tower we could not see; The divine point of the tower we could not see was covered by mist."
MusicBO;3;1161;The bearer of this greeting is my young friend Karl Ritter, whose visit I announced to F. LISZT 37 in my last letter.
MusicBO;3;1582;"Do not fail to return the manuscript of my ""Lohengrin"" article, of which, if necessary, you might have a copy made at Zurich."
MusicBO;3;1632;My whole correspondence has fallen into the most lamentable arrears through the sad condition I have lived in for more than a fortnight.
MusicBO;3;1692;To have a copy made here would exceed my limited means, and would also take too long, as they are pressing at Brussels.
MusicBO;3;1883;"Then came the number of the ""Illustrirte Zeitung"" of April 12th, and once more I read your printed article from beginning to end."
MusicBO;3;1982;I can make good use of it in connection with the pamphlet which is to be published (in French) in June by Brockhaus.
MusicBO;3;1986;At present I cannot help thinking it advisable to make some eclectic concessions (alas! alas!) to the existing state of our theatrical institutions.
MusicBO;3;2051;Candidly speaking, what do you seek just now, and with your present activity amongst the Italians, otherwise than an increase of your fame?
MusicBO;3;2355;I firmly hope for a future realization, for there is too much creative impulse in me not to nourish hope along with it.
MusicBO;3;2388;Unfortunately I was last week in such a turmoil of business that I could not find a quiet hour to read the book.
MusicBO;3;2539;To Princees Wittgenstein, who has delighted me with a very friendly letter, I ask you to express my best thanks for her kindness.
MusicBO;3;2716;First of all, I must thank you for the news of the continued activity which you employ in the propaganda of my works.
MusicBO;3;3108;Germany, first of all, must take the lead, for you have the advantage and the misfortune of being an arch-German poet and composer.
MusicBO;3;3362;"This then is the only basis on which a performance, be it of ""Tannhauser"" or of ""Lohengrin"", will henceforth be possible in Berlin."
MusicBO;3;3454;All I want is sufficient charm of life to get into the indispensable cheerful mood from which motives spring forth gladly and spontaneously.
MusicBO;3;3528;"I send you the honorarium for the score of the ""Flying Dutchman"", about which Herr von Zigesar has also written to you yesterday."
MusicBO;3;3814;By word of mouth I shall let you know about various opinions which in the meantime I listen to without comment or discussion.
MusicBO;3;4155;My best compliments to your wife, and many thanks for the kindness and love his wife showed me during my stay at Zurich.
MusicBO;3;4484;if it is taken in hand seriously, for then I shall have hope for a possible success of the enterprise even without me.
MusicBO;3;4691;I hope that by that time you will have received your passport, and we can then at once concoct our journey to Paris.
MusicBO;3;182;It will be a true pleasure to me to see him here again in the month of May, according to his promise.
MusicBO;3;350;I have a friend there, Alexander Mueller, who will assist me in furnishing as cheap a home as is to be had.
MusicBO;3;772;Do not be angry if I assure you that I shall be compelled to count upon your kind fulfillment of this promise.
MusicBO;3;837;"; I feel certain you will procure every possible and necessary means, and even if only in Weimar will refuse you nothing."
MusicBO;3;987;I do not thank you, for you alone have the power to thank yourself by your joy in being what you are.
MusicBO;3;1233;that end being in rational opera the drama, which is most emphatically placed in the hands of the representatives on the stage.
MusicBO;3;1613;provided I can find a publisher, to bring out my three romantic opera-poems, with a preface introducing them and explaining their genesis.
MusicBO;3;1789;If he had possessed or acquired the necessary talent, he would in that direction have made himself a position as a nobleman.
MusicBO;3;1852;DEAR FRIEND, I passed the whole of March in such trouble and distress, that I could not write to my Dresden friend.
MusicBO;3;1977;The day after tomorrow I have to go to Eilsen for the third time, but hope to be back here at Whitsuntide.
MusicBO;3;2187;Considering his cool, quiet, and passionless nature, the faithful attachment and friendship of this young man are of great value to me.
MusicBO;3;2657;Ah, I wish I could this summer make at last a beautiful journey, and that I knew how to set about it!
MusicBO;3;3603;In order not to forget your question as to the titles, I will answer the titles at once, as best I can.
MusicBO;3;3706;If it had not been for a few enthusiastic women at Weimar, I should have heard nothing of the third opera week.
MusicBO;3;3734;So I shall go to Spain, to Andalusia, and make friends, and try once more to live as well as I can.
MusicBO;3;3773;I had already indicated to MY DEAR FRIEND that I did not expect an answer from Dresden before my departure from here.
MusicBO;3;3816;"Herewith, dearest, best of friends, I send you the answer of the Prague manager, containing particulars as to the prohibition of ""Tannhauser."
MusicBO;3;4111;You might stay with me, but I am afraid you would not be comfortable, especially if you come with Joachim and Franz.
MusicBO;3;4405;You might also apologize to him for this very letter, which, I believe, is written in a terribly bad and confused style.
MusicBO;3;300;To speak briefly, tomorrow I shall begin a searching article on the theatre of the future for some important, political journal.
MusicBO;3;461;I have no longer the heart for the heart, and desire from all my soul soon to do something new instead.
MusicBO;3;698;But I need not tell you how delicate such a step is, and how difficult to lead to a good end.
MusicBO;3;797;DEAR FRIEND, I have just returned to Weymar, and hasten to send you a bill on Rothschild for five hundred francs.
MusicBO;3;1046;You say so many things to me that I become quite confused when I have to think of a detailed answer.
MusicBO;3;1617;"I recently had a letter from a friend in Paris who witnessed several rehearsals of the ""Tannhauser"" overture under Seghers's direction."
MusicBO;3;1802;"Perhaps I may try on this occasion to comprehend your ideas a little better, which in your book ""Kunst und Revolution"
MusicBO;3;1959;"The satisfactory settlement of this matter rejoices me cordially; and, as you may imagine, I have perfect faith in your work."
MusicBO;3;2172;"Send to me here, please, if you possess them, the numbers of the ""Monatsschrift"" of Kollatschek containing your and Uhlig's articles."
MusicBO;3;2408;As far as I am concerned, I am still occupied in resting from the finally somewhat powerful effect of my cure.
MusicBO;3;2615;"I feel so-so; the beautiful spring weather cheers me after a somewhat dreary winter, and I shall begin my poem again."
MusicBO;3;2646;"In the consequences which, as I am told, you expect from the performance of ""Cellini"", I cannot believe; that is all."
MusicBO;3;2678;"The news I received from various sides as to the performances of the ""Flying Dutchman"" could not but greatly please me."
MusicBO;3;2848;Do not allow other undertakings or claims to detract or detain you from this great enterprise, the task of your life.
MusicBO;3;2855;I was truly delighted with it, and mean to repeat the splendid work as soon as there is a good opportunity.
MusicBO;3;2914;Altogether I look upon this opera as the ablest work that has been written by a German composer these ten years.
MusicBO;3;3492;I was persuaded to call in a doctor, and he, a careful, considerate, and conscientious man, takes much trouble with me.
MusicBO;3;3961;"So much is certain: I fully share your predilection for ""Lohengrin""; it is the best thing I have done so far."
MusicBO;3;4110;Saturday, July 2nd, in the morning, or at the latest in the evening, I shall await you at the mail office.
MusicBO;3;4216;his wife had to leave at once after the concert on July 12th, in order to attend to some starring engagements.
MusicBO;3;4249;I have sent the book to Wagner, and my book makes me anxious to think that my book might displease him
MusicBO;3;4766;I suppose you have nothing to write to me, dear Franz, or else you would have sent me a few lines.
MusicBO;3;4852;A list of the theatres which will have to apply to the new proprietor will be found on the enclosed sheet.
MusicBO;3;4910;"Such, however, is unfortunately not the case; and I am in the unpleasant position of having to forward you a refusal."
MusicBO;3;78;BEST OF FRIENDS, Cordial greetings, and best thanks for the many and manifold troubles you have taken on my behalf.
MusicBO;3;199;If the world belonged to us, I believe we should do something to give pleasure to the people living therein.
MusicBO;3;388;At last I received a letter from my wife, and many pangs of conscience were again roused by a letter.
MusicBO;3;525;this, in the language of our dear nineteenth century, means, Send her as much money as you can possibly get.
MusicBO;3;656;"I have tried to relieve you of the burden of this exclusive reliance; I have turned elsewhere, but in vain."
MusicBO;3;704;so subtle an idea as would be the positive encouragement and the active protection of an artist of your stamp.
MusicBO;3;914;I am about to crush some most absurd rumours which have been spread abroad concerning me by returning to Zurich.
MusicBO;3;969;I come to a point which pains me much, but which it is my duty not to conceal from you.
MusicBO;3;1012;Judge then, can you blame my conviction which rids me of all egoism, of all the small passions of ambition?
MusicBO;3;1036;Do not forget that Weimar also would not exist for me if you did not happen to exist in Weimar.
MusicBO;3;1068;Our violoncellos will be strengthened by the arrival from Paris of Cossmann, who will join our orchestra on August 15th.
MusicBO;3;1448;What I said was this: that I wanted nothing of the public beyond a healthy sense and a human heart.
MusicBO;3;1745;"At the beginning of spring I hope to commence the composition of ""Siegfried,"" and to continue the work without interruption."
MusicBO;3;1803;I could not manage very well, and in that case I shall cook a French sauce to a French sauce.
MusicBO;3;2381;I enclose a letter from Herr von Zigesar, the contents of which I know, but have by no means inspired.
MusicBO;3;2423;The conclusion I have recently altered a little, but in such a manner that everything referring to Weimar remains unchanged.
MusicBO;3;2442;I took the liberty of arranging a recital of it for the Hereditary Grand Duke and his wife at Zigesar's.
MusicBO;3;2498;I do not expect its performance, not at least during my lifetime, and least of all at Berlin or Dresden.
MusicBO;3;3262;I celebrated on this occasion a perfect triumph in your cause, for now that the success has been so decided
MusicBO;3;3328;To your most important kind letter recently received I shall soon send an answer which, I hope, will please you.
MusicBO;3;3453;I was never before so determined as to musical execution as I am now and with regard to this poem.
MusicBO;3;3831;I have faith in the future of the human race, and that faith I draw simply from my inner necessity.
MusicBO;3;3998;I lose a nice income for this summer, for the undertaking would have brought me in a few thousand francs.
MusicBO;3;4839;If I had to get up in the morning without taking at once to my music, I should be unhappy.
MusicBO;3;88;", I hasten to let you know that ""Tannhauser"" is announced for performance here on Sunday next, September 24th."
MusicBO;3;401;But this I cannot possibly tell the princes at the moment when I am about to claim their assistance.
MusicBO;3;541;The more I enter into its conception and masterly execution, the higher rises my enthusiasm for this extraordinary work.
MusicBO;3;771;You were kind enough to promise me some assistance from your own means towards the end of the year.
MusicBO;3;1016;"Last May I sent the poem of my ""Siegfried"" to a book-seller to be published, such as it is."
MusicBO;3;1212;Allow me to explain myself a little more particularly, and forgive my mistake of not having done so before.
MusicBO;3;1444;Dearest friend, I agree with Dearest friend so fully that I did not even mention it to Dearest friend.
MusicBO;3;1786;I could tell you many things in a half-and-half way, but you had better think them out for yourself.
MusicBO;3;2124;you cannot come, I shall have a copy made at once and send a copy made at once you.
MusicBO;3;2195;I send them to you all the same, although I should almost like to ask you to ignore them.
MusicBO;3;2275;When I was going to send a poem to you, I for the first time felt a peculiar anxiety.
MusicBO;3;2330;With sad candour I must tell you that, after all, I consider your trouble about Weimar to be fruitless.
MusicBO;3;2385;In any case I am prepared for better or worse, and hope to continue quietly in my modest way.
MusicBO;3;2895;As to the definite performance of the three operas we must have a good talk when the time comes.
MusicBO;3;3169;Shall I implore the King of Saxony, or perhaps his ministers, for mercy, humble myself, and confess my repentance?
MusicBO;3;3206;But of one thing you must think, if nothing else is possible: we must see each other next summer.
MusicBO;3;3575;, are in themselves very desirable, because Leipzig, etc keep the matter warm and facilitate the conquest of Berlin.
MusicBO;3;3601;It annoys me specially on account of the manager, who in the whole affair has behaved energetically and charmingly.
MusicBO;3;3978;It is hard that you will have to leave me in my loneliness for the whole month of June.
MusicBO;3;4088;I enclose a few disappointing lines concerning your affair, which have been sent to me by an unknown hand.
MusicBO;3;4385;Is it not possible that, after all, we, with our secret pretensions, should simply be stupid and insolent fools?
MusicBO;3;4394;"At Leipzig I shall attend to the ""Lohengrin"" affair; so far I have heard nothing about the ""Lohengrin"" affair."
MusicBO;3;4512;Solitude and disconsolate loneliness from morning till night—such are the days that follow each other and make up life.
MusicBO;3;4706;Consider this, and do not forget that we are to meet at Basle on the evening of October 6th.
MusicBO;3;5010;"However, so it must be; and side issues must not be allowed to impede or endanger the principal question."
MusicBO;3;147;Dear friend, by that very means you have at this moment lifted me up as by a charm.
MusicBO;3;181;"Remember me very affectionately to Tichatschek; Tichatschek has been an admirable artist and a charming comrade and friend."
MusicBO;3;328;One single piece of good news, and I float once more on the top of the ocean waves.
MusicBO;3;562;Please address and send the manuscript, together with the enclosed letter, to the publisher Otto Wigand in Leipzig.
MusicBO;3;629;That force would always make me fritter away my genuine power, would always conjure up the same evils.
MusicBO;3;1045;Although I have many more things to tell you, I think it better to conclude on this page.
MusicBO;3;1082;"MY DEAREST FRIEND, Many thanks for your letter received yesterday; also convey my cordial thanks to the donor."
MusicBO;3;1259;I had occasion to point out the neglect of some scenic indications on the part of individual singers.
MusicBO;3;1364;DEAREST LISZT, I must today write you a few additional lines with reference to my recent long letter.
MusicBO;3;1676;Finally, I ask you to transmit my sincerest and most cordial respects to your faithful, highly esteemed friend.
MusicBO;3;1737;Could you give me some news, or are you angry that I have troubled you with this affair?
MusicBO;3;1932;But from inner causes arose the necessity to relinquish all considerations of common prudence with regard to him.
MusicBO;3;2267;"My next attempt at dramatizing the chief catastrophe of that great action for our theatre was ""Siegfried's Death""."
MusicBO;3;2367;"When you receive these lines, I shall be back in Zurich, where my address will be ""Zeltweg, Zurich."
MusicBO;3;2698;"Of the Ballenstedt Musical Festival, with the ""Tannhauser"" overture, and the ""Liebesmahl der Apostel,"" you have probably heard."
MusicBO;3;2725;(In that sense you are quite right in saying that this overture is altogether a work by itself.)
MusicBO;3;2833;I hope to submit to you the whole poem of the tetralogy before the end of the summer.
MusicBO;3;3028;that I always have a thousand anxieties, especially when I do not receive news from them for long.
MusicBO;3;3610;This, in my opinion, would best indicate the character of the pieces in accordance with the events represented.
MusicBO;3;3638;"I hope to write tomorrow; I have to thank him for his unusually rich gift for the ""Dutchman""."
MusicBO;3;3725;But they must not expect of me the disgrace of making a confession of repentance of any kind.
MusicBO;3;3948;"His last letter is a kind of dithyramb about ""Lohengrin,"" which naturally predisposes me favourably towards the man."
MusicBO;3;4053;It would have been different if you could have stayed with me there for some length of time.
MusicBO;3;4093;I have just received from Hartel your portrait, which seems to me more like than the previous one.
MusicBO;3;4097;If you like to write to me, address Poste restante, Carlsruhe, where I shall be till July 1st.
MusicBO;3;4109;I have not much to write in answer beyond expressing my joy that you are coming so soon.
MusicBO;3;4248;Do not expect to find anything in it, lest I should have the misfortune of incurring your censure.
MusicBO;3;4437;"His new book will appear soon, in which there is a separate chapter entitled ""Criticism of R. Wagner."
MusicBO;3;4587;I have found many silly letters here, amongst others the enclosed from Director Engel, of Kroll's establishment, Berlin.
MusicBO;3;4916;"Lohengrin"" is announced at Leipzig, but probably the first performance will be delayed till the 26th (Boxing Day)."
MusicBO;3;4950;I am, it is true, for the moment in an awkward position, but you must not mind that.
MusicBO;3;4959;"At times also my somewhat cloudy situation disturbs me; there is at present an ominous calm around me."
MusicBO;3;111;Please remember me also to Herr Genast, and let me soon have some news of Herr Genast.
MusicBO;3;563;Perhaps I shall succeed in drawing from my inferior literary faculty some small support for my existence.
MusicBO;3;582;"The day before yesterday I sent you a long article; probably you have read a long article."
MusicBO;3;680;"Believe me, I speak sincerely and openly; believe me that in dear friend lies my only hope."
MusicBO;3;785;I trust you and the above-mentioned friends will be able to provide me with the necessary means.
MusicBO;3;809;It depends very much upon the chance of a good opportunity, which I hope will turn up.
MusicBO;3;970;"Your return to Germany and visit to Weymar for the performance of ""Lohengrin"" is an absolute impossibility."
MusicBO;3;1060;Do not thank me, and do not thank Herr von Zigesar either, who has signed the bill.
MusicBO;3;1169;I shall spend the day and evening of the 28th with my wife alone on the Righi.
MusicBO;3;1507;"I am occupied with a work the title of which is to be ""The Essence of Opera."
MusicBO;3;1537;That you have remained faithful to me is more important to me than perhaps you know yourself.
MusicBO;3;1769;I could never think of forgetting you, and, if possible, still less of being angry with you.
MusicBO;3;1943;If you don't approve of something here, shut your eyes to you don't approve of something here.
MusicBO;3;2050;You do not want them in order to achieve something beautiful and at the same time useful.
MusicBO;3;2346;Fortunately I am in a position not to cause you any disagreeable difficulty as to this point.
MusicBO;3;2459;"The Princess has written a few words to you after the performance of ""Lohengrin,"" which I enclose."
MusicBO;3;2603;It would be a beautiful and gladsome thing if by that time you were back in Germany.
MusicBO;3;2782;Try what you can do with Herr Beck, and explain to him what is the important part.
MusicBO;3;2820;"I am hard at work and eager to finish the poem of my ""Valkyrie"" in a fortnight."
MusicBO;3;3137;I can explain to myself how it happened that I did not hit upon this simple method:
MusicBO;3;3315; I have read with much interest, and, let us hope, with some benefit for our representations.
MusicBO;3;3353;This has eased my heart, and by Hulsen's fault I have been released from all previous concessions.
MusicBO;3;3360;You will, I think, prefer to keep up communication solely with the Prince and Princess of Prussia.
MusicBO;3;3550;If it is not too much trouble, I ask you specially to arrange this also for me.
MusicBO;3;3564;"If it is possible, send me about three copies more; I can make good use of them."
MusicBO;3;3739;Let me know soon, and know for certain, whether I may come back to Germany or not.
MusicBO;3;4266;"; perhaps you hold a similar opinion, or rather you know, as you have been with Wagner."
MusicBO;3;4270;Wotan is sublime, like a statue in bronze, and yet so humanly conceivable at the same time.
MusicBO;3;4798;Small as may be the result that I can achieve, it is not, I think, altogether illusory.
MusicBO;3;4946;I am angry with myself for having burdened an overpatient friend like you with this Hartel affair.
MusicBO;3;307;I do not expect to reach the goal here so very soon but must prepare myself.
MusicBO;3;417;I am good for nothing, except perhaps writing operas, and that I cannot do in London.
MusicBO;3;487;I want to get into some kind of swing again so that the bell may ring.
MusicBO;3;597;Consider that I can give you nothing better in return than the best I can accomplish.
MusicBO;3;634;I can work is a small nucleus of individuals who constitute my whole publicity at present.
MusicBO;3;702;By his superior intelligence and personal love of music, access to him will be made easier.
MusicBO;3;762;You perceive that I am only intent on carrying out the scheme originally suggested by you.
MusicBO;3;840;Herr von Luttichau has bought it of me for the price of the copying (thirty-six thalers).
MusicBO;3;890;A newly revised libretto intended for the printer I send at the same time with this.
MusicBO;3;974;Speak to no one of this plan, which I hope to carry out in due time.
MusicBO;3;1268;In order to produce this feeling very distinctly and tangibly, I invented the following dramatic point:
MusicBO;3;1375;"You cannot believe how delighted I was to hear some particulars of your music to ""Prometheus."
MusicBO;3;1549;In consequence I have lately become accustomed to the thought of giving up the poem altogether.
MusicBO;3;1620;"My request to you to accept my poem of ""Wiland,"" you apparently have not quite understood."
MusicBO;3;1642;MY DEAR LISZT, At last I am able to send you the translation of your article.
MusicBO;3;1815;But necessity compels me to gain some certainty as to my own position through your means.
MusicBO;3;1908;"; I can and will not ask her for anything even in the most indirect manner."
MusicBO;3;2339;This last is one of the most painful features of the explanation which will be necessary.
MusicBO;3;2577;As soon as the air grows a little warm and clear the poem will be begun.
MusicBO;3;2711;About everything else I shall write to you at greater length within the next few days.
MusicBO;3;3055;"Have you forgotten the ""Faust"" overture and the designs for ""Lohengrin"" for which I asked you?"
MusicBO;3;3121;I know how great this new sacrifice is which I expect of MY DEAR FRIEND and
MusicBO;3;3256;It will be a great joy to me to grasp your creation through your immediate aid.
MusicBO;3;3355;I accept your generous offer, and place all my further relations with Berlin in your hands.
MusicBO;3;3536;The time has not yet come for explaining the details of this matter to you, and
MusicBO;3;3724;(If they wish it, they may place me under police supervision as much as they like.)
MusicBO;3;3845;That I must remain so far from my battlefield is what makes me complain so often.
MusicBO;3;3960;The impression was most powerful, and I had to make every effort not to break down.
MusicBO;3;4006;It implies indeed a gross insult, for which one must pardon our dull-headed theatrical mob. 
MusicBO;3;4184;"Let me talk of business; all else has become too terrible for my pen and ink"
MusicBO;3;4239;Enclosed I send you a letter from Kohler, which you may on occasion return to me.
MusicBO;3;4255;At first it was strange to me, but attracted me as something strange does attract us.
MusicBO;3;4443;We form a little Church of our own, and edify each other by singing your praises.
MusicBO;3;4545;But now you must do all in your power to assist me in making it possible.
MusicBO;3;4845;By that means I overrate my immediate income, and consequently spend considerably more than I possess.
MusicBO;3;4934;"I should have liked much to send you a different answer from the Hartels; but, alas!"
MusicBO;3;24;The committee of which I am a member will apply to you with proper formality.
MusicBO;3;233;Moreover, I hope to employ my stay at Zurich in obtaining a passport for France.
MusicBO;3;369;I might then entirely devote to the payment of the debts I left in Dresden.
MusicBO;3;425;For the present the present would not be very diplomatic to knock at battered doors.
MusicBO;3;463;I want you to decide about this as soon as you have heard our reasons.
MusicBO;3;654;Dear friend, you, I believe, are the only one on whom I can implicitly rely.
MusicBO;3;693;I might say exclusively—German, can at most be represented in five or six German towns.
MusicBO;3;859;Better than anything else I should have liked to get out of the world altogether.
MusicBO;3;1047;I know that I am safe with you as a child in its mother's bosom.
MusicBO;3;1105;I have every reason to feel friendly towards him, and do so in very deed.
MusicBO;3;1586;I had to see to the return of the manuscript, entrusted to me, and this
MusicBO;3;1629;, I have just spent about ten days in bed fighting with a violent fever.
MusicBO;3;1758;My poor dear little parrot was my spiritus familiaris, the good brownie of my house.
MusicBO;3;1835;I am aware that everything has turned out unfavourably for your plan of helping me.
MusicBO;3;2115;Can you visit me, or at least appoint a place, accessible to me, for meeting?
MusicBO;3;2154;But, alas! this year it is quite impossible for me to think of any journey
MusicBO;3;2219;I have written this to him in my last letter, which should have reached him.
MusicBO;3;2410;"How could you think that I had sent you ""Young Siegfried"" only to look at?"
MusicBO;3;2444;I am very curious as to how you are going to execute the work musically
MusicBO;3;2447;Perhaps you will be able to complete the whole work in less than three years.
MusicBO;3;2468;You would certainly be satisfied with the progress they all make at each new representation.
MusicBO;3;2499;These and similar large towns, with their public, do not exist for me at all.
MusicBO;3;2639;"What is this you have heard about me in connection with your performance of ""Cellini""?"
MusicBO;3;2869;will no one give me pleasure to spend the money on a trip of recreation.
MusicBO;3;3024;If this guarantee is refused, I have given instructions that the score shall be withdrawn.
MusicBO;3;3072;Think this over, and do not be angry in case I have said something stupid.
MusicBO;3;3158;"to me ""enjoyment of life, of love,"" is a matter of imagination, not of experience."
MusicBO;3;3178;"Perhaps you would at once understand my tone-poem if I called it ""Faust in Solitude""."
MusicBO;3;3182;I had a theme for her, but a theme for her was only a theme.
MusicBO;3;3367;However, I must bear this and remain in my old state of resignation and want.
MusicBO;3;3494;Certain it is that if I do not recover, it will not be his fault.
MusicBO;3;3578;We shall soon take some walks together, for which you will want good steady legs.
MusicBO;3;3584;But, before all, I must be more accurately informed of the actual state of things.
MusicBO;3;3600;It would be an excellent thing if you could succeed in having this interdict withdrawn.
MusicBO;3;3710;How absurd it is on your part to worry yourself in order to help me!
MusicBO;3;3750;I wish we two could start straight from here to go into the wide world.
MusicBO;3;3794;Probably he will stay here for a day on his way back, and through him
MusicBO;3;3867;We must have a long talk about my further practical plans as to the performance.
MusicBO;3;4010;I must own that I frequently grieve to see how you waste your strength there.
MusicBO;3;4397;Let me today, dear Franz, thank you by a few lines for your last letter.
MusicBO;3;4400;The only thing I can think of is seeing you again in the present year.
MusicBO;3;4423;"I should be proud if this ""man of talent"" would decline to assist me altogether."
MusicBO;3;4431;Truly, writing is a misery, and men of our sort should not write at all.
MusicBO;3;4578;I am anxious because I have had no letter from DEAREST FRIEND for so long.
MusicBO;3;4689;I should like to come again to Zurich, but am too much pressed for time.
MusicBO;3;4937;Next summer I hope to visit you and to stay with you for some time.
MusicBO;3;4955;I spin myself in like a cocoon, but I also spin something out of myself.
MusicBO;3;4989;House crowded, so that on the first occasion many people had to be refused admission.
MusicBO;3;5008;Of course in similar affairs I have to take the mild position of a mediator,
MusicBO;3;83;In any case I hope soon to see you again, and am glad accordingly.
MusicBO;3;201;What shall I do with the beautiful letter I received together with your own?
MusicBO;3;250;I am particularly anxious to get her out of Saxony, and especially out of
MusicBO;3;255;Thanks, cordial thanks, to you for the great kindness you have shown to me!
MusicBO;3;264;You will soon hear more from your RICHARD WAGNER ZURICH, March 20th, 1849 18.
MusicBO;3;501;I receive today a letter from my wife, unfortunately much delayed in the post.
MusicBO;3;701;I shall probably have the honour of paying him at the beginning of January.
MusicBO;3;773;I trust in no one else, and do not indulge in any further illusions.
MusicBO;3;834;"You are the only one to whom I could address this prayer; to none"
MusicBO;3;853;"DEAREST LISZT, I herewith send you the promised directions for the performance of ""Lohengrin."
MusicBO;3;869;But now I have first of all a great wish to address to you
MusicBO;3;1067;We have ordered a bass clarinet, which will be excellently played by Herr Wahlbrul.
MusicBO;3;1157;My asking you to send me a proof of the libretto (now too late).
MusicBO;3;1293;At this moment I receive your letter, assuring me of your joy and friendship.
MusicBO;3;1391;"I exclaimed when we tried for the first time the first scenes of ""Lohengrin."
MusicBO;3;1445;What I object to are the perverse demands which are made on the public.
MusicBO;3;1460;Let us show to one another in ourselves that there is worth in man.
MusicBO;3;1560;"Today I send you by post a fair copy of my article on ""Lohengrin."
MusicBO;3;1624;"If you intend, however late, to finish ""Wiland,"" I will undertake its proper versification."
MusicBO;3;1788;B. is a nobleman who has spent long years in becoming a literary good-for-nothing.
MusicBO;3;1842;It is very sad that I have to trouble you with this ugly request.
MusicBO;3;1868;You know me, and are aware that you can have implicit confidence in me.
MusicBO;3;1992;, I must wipe a blush of shame off my face before answering you.
MusicBO;3;2108;With my violent way of working, I am always considerably tired at the end.
MusicBO;3;2134;This, in my opinion, is a nobility of conduct which makes me feel ashamed.
MusicBO;3;2269;"To get rid of this desperate mood, I wrote the book ""Oper und Drama."
MusicBO;3;2483;Who could fail to speak of his spirit, of his genius, of his intelligence?
MusicBO;3;2685;For your kind offer of the designs I thank you, and accept it eagerly.
MusicBO;3;2704;Today I write only a few hurried lines in order to avoid a misunderstanding.
MusicBO;3;2776;How can we expect a minor singer to do what T. failed to accomplish?
MusicBO;3;2877;Uhlig will arrange the score for you as soon as Uhlig receives your copy.
MusicBO;3;2953;To me there is something horrible in witnessing this attempt at galvanizing and resuscitating.
MusicBO;3;3008;I see nothing of them here, and, in fact, learn scarcely anything about music.
MusicBO;3;3152;As yet I have not replied with a line to either Hulsen or X.
MusicBO;3;3221;"Next week you will receive my remarks on the performance of the ""Flying Dutchman""."
MusicBO;3;3235;How sad for a friend to be able to say no more than this.
MusicBO;3;3441;He was the first litterateur who ever paid attention to me as a poet.
MusicBO;3;3451;But I am looking forward with much delight to setting all this to music.
MusicBO;3;3499;"Let us leave it alone; we cannot alter it; it has always been so."
MusicBO;3;3765;You want to go into the wide world to live, to enjoy, to luxuriate.
MusicBO;3;3952;About Brendel, who recently visited me here, I have several things to tell you.
MusicBO;3;4050;I have nothing to write to you, dearest, except that I await you longingly.
MusicBO;3;4073;Within six days they gave a striking incident four times, with the largest receipts.
MusicBO;3;4089;I hope to be able to tell you better news when I see you.
MusicBO;3;4219;I told her many and sundry things which his wife was able to understand.
MusicBO;3;4325;I am too restless to give up all activity for such a long time.
MusicBO;3;4446;This is my true conviction, without pedantry and charlatanism, both of which I abhor.
MusicBO;3;4519;I start from here, and arrive in Turin on the 29th at the latest.
MusicBO;3;4566;"I should like so much to meet you in Paris; it would be splendid."
MusicBO;3;4568;But Berlioz is a noble fellow, and all will be right in the end.
MusicBO;3;4634;"If there should be a delay of the performance, it will do no harm;"
MusicBO;3;4671;"You appear to be well and in good spirits; you are a happy man."
MusicBO;3;4684;When all is settled, I will let you know how it has been done.
MusicBO;3;4800;"All the rest is moonshine to me with the sole exception of Berlioz's ""Cellini."
MusicBO;3;4807;In all probability the performance this year will be better than the previous ones.
MusicBO;3;4824;Sing and write, therefore, and get rid of your brain abscess by that means.
MusicBO;3;38;Let me thank you sincerely for the great kindnesses you have shown me.
MusicBO;3;229;I hope that his political experience will understand this addition to his passport.
MusicBO;3;231;To your counsel and your active aid, dear friends, I owe my safety.
MusicBO;3;498;Probably not, as you are just opening a letter from your plaguing spirit.
MusicBO;3;550;Hold me in kind remembrance, even as I am cordially devoted to you.
MusicBO;3;630;In all I do and think I am only artist, nothing but artist.
MusicBO;3;752;More I will tell you as soon as I have finished the scenario.
MusicBO;3;763;Do not be angry with me for taking it in hand so late.
MusicBO;3;805;Paris and perhaps London are absolutely necessary for your present and future career.
MusicBO;3;822;, You will know by this time how I have fared in Paris.
MusicBO;3;831;An immense desire has sprung up in me to have this work performed.
MusicBO;3;862;First of all, I have in the enclosed treated of scenery and decorations.
MusicBO;3;1099;But I have to bear so many things, and shall bear this also.
MusicBO;3;1151;I am uncertain because you make no mention of its contents, which were1.
MusicBO;3;1179;, I cannot stop to point out any particular passage, combination, or effect.
MusicBO;3;1505;I do not know what moved me to speak bitterly of newspaper notices.
MusicBO;3;1637;Send me soon one of those long letters which you write so beautifully.
MusicBO;3;1671;is the funereal chant which I have to sing to every young day.
MusicBO;3;1844;May Heaven grant that you will soon be relieved from your domestic troubles.
MusicBO;3;1855;In any case the opera will be given twice more during this season.
MusicBO;3;1863;Perhaps I shall succeed in settling the matter by the middle of May.
MusicBO;3;1867;I need not tell you that I do not want this for myself.
MusicBO;3;2032;If, however, you print the letter, omit what you think unfit for publicity.
MusicBO;3;2057;One thing more, however: work thoroughly for the culture of your theatrical people.
MusicBO;3;2241;"I withdraw my consent to his opinion; my consent was given in haste."
MusicBO;3;2531;It is just the same with the appearance of the body of Elizabeth.
MusicBO;3;2626;Nothing else you could do in these days would compensate you for it.
MusicBO;3;2670;and therefore I may expect you for the Flying, not the lying-down, Dutchman.
MusicBO;3;2729;But so many things are now to me inconceivable and yet quite conceivable.
MusicBO;3;2810;I hear those people throw plenty of ducats out of window just now.
MusicBO;3;2842;It would be nice of Herr Dingelstedt to think of such a thing.
MusicBO;3;2878;A thousand thanks for all you have again done for my works lately.
MusicBO;3;3163;Here I must perish in the very shortest space of time, and everything—
MusicBO;3;3208;Promise me for quite certain in your next letter that you will come.
MusicBO;3;3246;as yet the public and the papers are to know nothing of it.
MusicBO;3;3251;You will easily guess what has brought me to this maturely considered resolution.
MusicBO;3;3487;I have no hopes at all for the further spreading of my operas.
MusicBO;3;3489;Once more I have to regret that I yielded to a sanguine hope.
MusicBO;3;3594;If it has not arrived, I must apply for it at the post-office.
MusicBO;3;3933;If this is confirmed, the other step which I contemplated will become useless.
MusicBO;3;4031;We have become friends, and shall probably approach each other still more closely.
MusicBO;3;4048;Let us be faithful to one another, though the world go to ruin.
MusicBO;3;4086;On July 2nd I shall therefore hope to be with you at Zurich.
MusicBO;3;4124;At the latest, I shall be there on Sunday at the same hour.
MusicBO;3;4149;"With Schindelmeisser I shall communicate by telegraph early tomorrow morning; and in case"
MusicBO;3;4714;As to the rest, I am longing to get to work at last.
MusicBO;3;4808;"The ""Flying Dutchman"" was given yesterday, to the increased satisfaction of the public."
MusicBO;3;4825;Perhaps your sleep will become a little more reposeful in the same manner.
MusicBO;3;4956;"For five years I had written no music; now I am in Nibelheim."
MusicBO;3;4;There is, however, still another circumstance which encourages me to this step:
MusicBO;3;156;It comes from my fullest heart, and tears are in my eyes.
MusicBO;3;351;As soon as I can, I shall go there from this place.
MusicBO;3;379;But to battle about in this great world is impossible for me.
MusicBO;3;403;A general and public declaration also would bring me nothing but disgrace.
MusicBO;3;537;I hope his family will take an active interest in your affairs.
MusicBO;3;558;but I feel certain that your nature is at one with me.
MusicBO;3;682;Receive, together with mine, the most ardent wishes of my good wife.
MusicBO;3;727;Read over the Mystery, and tell me whether you like my plan.
MusicBO;3;757;As yet, however, I do not know a single person in London.
MusicBO;3;857;When we meet again, I shall have many things to tell you.
MusicBO;3;877;The passage is therefore to be omitted in the libretto as well.
MusicBO;3;927;Dearest friend, you have, I hope, received my long letter from Thun.
MusicBO;3;1191;"Before the end of the winter ""Lohengrin"" will certainly become a ""draw."
MusicBO;3;1270;At this moment I introduce in the orchestra in F minor ff.
MusicBO;3;1491;I have many and more important things to write to you about.
MusicBO;3;1519;I once more go to battle with my deadly enemy the winter.
MusicBO;3;1538;Accept my cordial thanks for the friendship you have preserved for me.
MusicBO;3;1600;I can only compare with the spirit in which you do it.
MusicBO;3;1721;"Of power and genius you have plenty; only do not lose patience."
MusicBO;3;1728;I have felt so lonely of late that I am often afraid.
MusicBO;3;1756;Ah! as long as we possess fancy we can pull along somehow.
MusicBO;3;2019;Where else can you find such things as are done at Weimar?
MusicBO;3;2414;, I want you amongst my Penates in one form or another.
MusicBO;3;2597;"She looks very well; and her husband is a handsome, decent gentleman."
MusicBO;3;2607;I think of producing it here in the course of the summer.
MusicBO;3;2840;"Do you know anything about ""Tannhauser"" being contemplated for Munich next autumn?"
MusicBO;3;2917;The glaciers are splendid fellows, and in the years of my youth
MusicBO;3;2966;Perhaps Henri Blaze would be the man to treat it in French.
MusicBO;3;2971;Is this artificial remodeling of old motives of life real artistic creativeness?
MusicBO;3;3210;We must see how I shall be able to exist till then.
MusicBO;3;3236;Of all the sad and disagreeable things which I have to suffer
MusicBO;3;3252;In the first instance I have faithfully to fulfill a serious duty.
MusicBO;3;3484;"I can now therefore sum up my gain from this glorious undertaking;"
MusicBO;3;3636;But all this leads me beyond the purpose of these hasty lines.
MusicBO;3;3732;"; I shall borrow and steal, if necessary, in order to travel."
MusicBO;3;3771;I cannot fail to see and desire in it the only salvation.
MusicBO;3;3797;If you have not read it, I shall send it to you.
MusicBO;3;3846;Well, my highest hope will be fulfilled: I shall see you again.
MusicBO;3;3870;Dearest, dearest friend, do not think that I meant to reproach you
MusicBO;3;3877;But how many, many things I shall have to say to you.
MusicBO;3;4202;Oh, come back soon, and stay with us for a long time.
MusicBO;3;4230;When I go to Carlsruhe, I shall again visit Moritz at Wiesbaden.
MusicBO;3;4291;The air here feels so thick, so buttery (so like rancid butter).
MusicBO;3;4293;", I do not care; you write your ""Nibelungen"" and ""Delenda Philisterium!"
MusicBO;3;4314;Live happy in the enjoyment of your power, my great, splendid Richard.
MusicBO;3;4409;Here I live in a wild solitude, ice and snow around me.
MusicBO;3;4410;The day before yesterday we roamed for half a day over glaciers.
MusicBO;3;4482;George promised me yesterday that George also would write to you today.
MusicBO;3;4491;In that manner I at one time became a speculative art philosopher.
MusicBO;3;4569;"Adieu, you best and dearest of all men; continue to love me."
MusicBO;3;4576;"Here you have the whole story of my journey, my ""Italian journey."
MusicBO;3;4582;But why is it that I hear nothing else of DEAREST FRIEND?
MusicBO;3;4588;It seems to me as if I could scarcely accept his proposition.
MusicBO;3;4676;In the meantime let me have news from Carlsruhe now and then.
MusicBO;3;4828;Do you remember a Herr Friedrich Schmitt, professor of singing at Munich?
MusicBO;3;4855;the other fifteen theatres have it cheaper than is in each case
MusicBO;3;5026;I presume you have received the medallion which the Princess sent you.
MusicBO;3;102;"You can do many, many things; of that I am persuaded."
MusicBO;3;132;Do you suppose I cannot judge of this from a distance?
MusicBO;3;177;"the album published by the ""Ladies' Society for the German Fleet."
MusicBO;3;358;Within half a year I shall send you the opera completed.
MusicBO;3;382;But I know your kindness, and trust in that account implicitly.
MusicBO;3;493;"; the Princess may find it difficult to remain my friend."
MusicBO;3;495;Farewell, and take my cordial thanks for your constancy and friendship.
MusicBO;3;509;At this moment I can offer her nothing in the world.
MusicBO;3;566;I presume that the excellent Princess is also happy and well.
MusicBO;3;1141;You will do it all right, perhaps better than I should.
MusicBO;3;1541;I have more designs than I have the power to execute.
MusicBO;3;1547;I cannot finish the poem now, either in words or music.
MusicBO;3;1552;In the more important places, I have written the verses myself.
MusicBO;3;1583;I shall want it between the 5th and l0th of November.
MusicBO;3;1598;I have also read your feuilleton in the Journal des Debats.
MusicBO;3;1646;I hesitated and wavered, and did not know how to begin.
MusicBO;3;1805;I shall send a French sauce you on the first opportunity.
MusicBO;3;1924;I do not hate him, but he disgusts me beyond measure.
MusicBO;3;1953;Farewell, and be pressed to the heart of your RICHARD WAGNER.
MusicBO;3;2023;This is the reason why I have applied to you alone.
MusicBO;3;2034;"You have probably received my little pamphlet ""Ein Theater in Zurich."
MusicBO;3;2208;As soon as I have read the articles which interest me
MusicBO;3;2313;Where and in what circumstances such a performance may become possible
MusicBO;3;2476;But Frau Knopp could not be more than an ambitious woman.
MusicBO;3;2563;, will soon hear a very good performance of that composition.
MusicBO;3;2594;I might possibly be of service to you in the matter.
MusicBO;3;2650;I wish that I could say as much to many people.
MusicBO;3;2652;"; you were in the right swing with it this season."
MusicBO;3;3003;I want particularly to have my beautiful designs of the scenery.
MusicBO;3;3081;Concerning Berlin, I repeat to you what I said before, viz.:-
MusicBO;3;3106;Can you expect to be ready by the end of 1854?
MusicBO;3;3311;My pen is getting too horribly blunt to write to you.
MusicBO;3;3377;From this day I shall have no further transactions with Berlin.
MusicBO;3;3508;Yea, in the fire of Valhall I should like to perish.
MusicBO;3;3530;In a few weeks the King of Saxony is expected here.
MusicBO;3;3667;"; in the summer I shall read my poem to you."
MusicBO;3;3742;Most of these would be effusions of thanks, as you know.
MusicBO;3;3770;You may scoff at this feeling as bitterly as you like.
MusicBO;3;3916;I cannot get away from here before the end of June.
MusicBO;3;3965;"These pieces have had a tremendous popular success; everybody was delighted."
MusicBO;3;4145;With E. Devrient I spent a few hours yesterday at Badenweiler.
MusicBO;3;4159;God grant that we may soon be able to repeat them.
MusicBO;3;4227;Frau Moritz is a very amiable and excellent woman and artist.
MusicBO;3;4271;"The close of the first act of the ""Valkyrie"" is overpowering."
MusicBO;3;4424;However, in this matter also you must do as you like.
MusicBO;3;4481;"As to K. I must wait; we shall see later on."
MusicBO;3;4842;This I can do by selling my theatrical royalties on Lohengrin.
MusicBO;3;4884;The receipts from the theatres (with the exception of those specified)
MusicBO;4;1851;The hope of being able to earn a large sum, say ten thousand dollars, in a short time, would, in the great helplessness of my pecuniary position, compel me, as a matter of course, to undertake this American expedition, although even in that case it would perhaps be absurd to sacrifice my best vital powers to so miserable a purpose, and, as my best vital powers were, in an indirect manner.
MusicBO;4;2345;"These tortures are all the greater because no one else can understand them, and because the most unsympathetic people believe that we are in reality like themselves; for the most unsympathetic people understand only just that part of us which we really have in common with them, and do not perceive how little, how almost nothing that is."
MusicBO;4;2983;At first I had to go through various troubles, for the furnishing of the little house, which has turned out very neat, and, according to my taste, took much time, and we had to move out before there was any possibility of moving in.
MusicBO;4;4522;Astonished at the possibility of an ill-natured misunderstanding, I read the letter once more, and was compelled to chime in with K. R.'s impetuous declamations at the incredible dulness, superficiality, and triviality of people who could have misunderstood the meaning of this letter.
MusicBO;4;881;Do you know how I can manage to arrange some concerts at Brussels and perhaps two Dutch towns, such as I gave last year at Zurich, and do you think that by such an undertaking I might make 10,000 francs in cash?
MusicBO;4;1129;but this is subject to all manner of chicanery, which is disgusting to me, and must be got out of the way, so that in future I may be able to pass without difficulty and at any time through and into France.
MusicBO;4;5007;I must also confess to you that my treading once more German soil did not produce the slightest impression upon me, except in so far as I was astonished at the insipidity and impertinence of the language I had to listen to.
MusicBO;4;3467;I feel a strong desire to communicate some of it to some one, and I fear I shall be tempted to play some of it to Berlioz one of these days, although my beautiful performance will probably terrify and disgust him.
MusicBO;4;5171;I, for my part, have clearly demonstrated, by word of mouth and by letter, what they would have to do, viz., to invite you here for the purpose of mounting and conducting those works in accordance with your instructions and wishes.
MusicBO;4;1278;I do not grudge your Berlin friends the satisfaction which this issue of the affair will give them, and hope that many other occasions will turn up on which I shall not be superfluous or inconvenient to you.
MusicBO;4;1591;He makes very good terms with his God, entering into a contract by which, after having carried out certain points agreed upon, he is finally admitted to eternal bliss as a compensation for various failures in this world.
MusicBO;4;779;It is obvious that, after two vain attempts to produce this work at the Royal Theatre, the management will not undertake a third as long as I have the honour of being at the head of it.
MusicBO;4;1922;Good gracious! such sums as I might EARN in America, people ought to GIVE me, without asking anything in return beyond what I am actually doing, and which is the best that I can do.
MusicBO;4;3723;In short, I am obstinately fixed on Venice, and do not want to think of any other choice, because it is not travelling about, but settling down as soon as possible that I care for.
MusicBO;4;467;"In their announcements they think it useful to put the matter in such a way as to make it appear that I have undertaken the direction of ""the Musical Festival"" conjointly with M."
MusicBO;4;2015;You probably know that I have to go to Vienna, in January, to conduct the Centenary Mozart Festival, which takes place on January 27th, and will require at least a few weeks' preparation.
MusicBO;4;2489;"Your Symphonic Poems are now quite familiar to me; Your Symphonic Poems are the only music which occupies me at present, for during my cure I must not think of doing any work."
MusicBO;4;2867;"I think they ought to pay me 1,000 thalers for each score, in each case on delivery of the manuscript—that is, for the ""Rhinegold,"" and perhaps for the ""Valkyrie"" also, now at once."
MusicBO;4;3238;Next week I shall go to Berlin for a few days, and from there I proceed straight to Aix, where I intend to go through the cure from July 22nd till August 10th.
MusicBO;4;4056;"I wrote to him that doubts had arisen in me whether I still desired the performance of ""Rienzi"" at Weimar, and I ask you to agree with me and give up the plan."
MusicBO;4;1473;Unfortunately I have lost my voice entirely, and can sing very little, so that I am afraid I shall not be able to be of much service to you in that way.
MusicBO;4;1582;"I had further to admire even in those sophisms his high poetic imagination and power of representation, just as I admire Beethoven's musical art in the last movement of his ""Ninth Sympthony."
MusicBO;4;1996;"The papers have no doubt informed you of his stay at Berlin, where Liszt will soon return to attend the first performance of ""Tannhauser,"" two rehearsals of which Liszt almost entirely conducted."
MusicBO;4;2723;Your last visit, much disturbed as was our intercourse, has left a decisive impression on me, which is this: your friendship is the most important and most significant event of my life.
MusicBO;4;4151;My ideal demands have increased, compared with former times, and my sensitiveness has become much more acute during the last ten years while I lived in absolute separation from artistic public life.
MusicBO;4;4272;"Perhaps I shall be able to broach the subject again later on, and obtain a more favourable result; to the extent, I mean, that a small sum will be sent to you."
MusicBO;4;4766;I have been brought here by the absurd illusion of being able, by repeating my Paris concerts at Brussels, to recover some of the money which those Paris excesses had cost me.
MusicBO;4;333;"I find it difficult to understand how Herr von Hulsen can be naive enough to think that I should consent to the performance of ""Tannhauser"" at Berlin by the Konigsberg troupe."
MusicBO;4;1595;"If that were so, it would be a bad thing for the large majority of men, who have only ""organs,"" but as good as no ""intelligence,"" at least in your sense."
MusicBO;4;1662;After that the band crowded round me to shake hands, and even some ladies and gentlemen of the public held out their hands to me, which I had to press warmly.
MusicBO;4;3098;At last you have found a comfortable habitation which has been prepared for you by tender friendship, and must be all the more pleasant and beneficial to you on that account.
MusicBO;4;489;It would be difficult to compile it to my liking, especially as the sketches are frightfully confused, so that no one but myself could make head or tail of them.
MusicBO;4;1692;You have kept me waiting long, which indeed I might have expected after my last letter from London, for to communications of this kind your reply has always been silence.
MusicBO;4;1976;In the luckiest case I shall not be able to go out into the air this year, and during the whole winter I shall live in continual fear of relapses.
MusicBO;4;2283;Fortunately I have, as AN ARTIST, reached such a stage that I need consider only my works of art and their success, but no longer the applause of the multitude.
MusicBO;4;2298;In case the King should refuse my request I might fall back upon the intercession of one of the Prussian ministers, which has been offered to me for that purpose.
MusicBO;4;2305;Unfortunately my late efforts and endeavours have not as yet led to a favourable result, which proves by no means that such may not be the case in the future.
MusicBO;4;2308;The only thing that I can advise, and which I most urgently request you to do, is to send at once your petition to His Majesty the King of Saxony.
MusicBO;4;2503;Four years I tried in vain to realise this wish, which I can accomplish only by buying a piece of ground and building a house on a piece of ground.
MusicBO;4;4257;I am fully aware that you are not able to put yourself in my place with such goodwill and understanding as would enable you to do justice to my letter.
MusicBO;4;4375;The pretty little house will be kept for me, and I hope to inhabit The pretty little house again later on in the summer, which would be an agreeable change.
MusicBO;4;5169;"I was told several times, and positively assured, that everything would be done here to further your efforts, and especially to effect the performance of ""The Nibelungen"" and of ""Tristan."
MusicBO;4;5173;I will not trouble you with the details of this affair, the failure of which, between ourselves, was my chief reason for giving up my connection with our theatre altogether.
MusicBO;4;588;You of course will not doubt for a moment that I feel sincerely grateful to you for the energy with which you take care of my interest with Hulsen.
MusicBO;4;1694;I need scarcely tell you that I am looking forward to it with great pleasure, and that our meeting will be to me the only joy after long trouble.
MusicBO;4;1949;The day after tomorrow I am going for a few days to Brunswick to conduct, on the 18th instant, one of the Symphony Concerts given by the orchestra there.
MusicBO;4;2390;If I look upon your artistic career, different as it is from any other, I clearly perceive the instinct which led you into the path now trodden by you.
MusicBO;4;2485;I go thoroughly to work in using this new and careful treatment, and feel sure of being completely cured of my ailment, which, after all, was caused by nervousness.
MusicBO;4;3942;The words are the hard, transparent pieces of incense, the melody is the beautiful scent which emerges from the thick clouds of smoke, when the incense has been lit.
MusicBO;4;4844;The question at stake is whether or not I shall be able to do something for the health of my wife this summer in accordance with the doctor's prescription.
MusicBO;4;5015;"On the other hand, I am, no doubt, very wrong in not accepting so true a friend as X. is; and I have much reason to acknowledge X.'s friendship."
MusicBO;4;4240;My first letter of this year will have shown you that I also am capable of considering the matter in a serious and literally pathetic, i.e., suffering mood.
MusicBO;4;4516;"This at least is good evidence of my receptive faculties; but I believe that the credit is really due to the peculiar grandeur and quality of your work."
MusicBO;4;519;I hope some means will be found of preserving my responsibility towards Wagner and his works without leading to an intrusion of myself on the Berlin artists.
MusicBO;4;844;In this series of articles I have once more clearly recognized myself, and have come to the conclusion that we have nothing in common with this world.
MusicBO;4;1004;I shall be in London at the beginning of March to conduct eight concerts, the first of which takes place March 12th, and the last June 25th.
MusicBO;4;1086;"I shall send you in a few days an English translation of your three opera poems in manuscript; it may be of use to you in London."
MusicBO;4;1762;During these last months I have been occupied so much by visits, correspondence, and business matters that I could scarcely devote a few hours to my work.
MusicBO;4;3048;So I must ask you, after all, to let me know at least what steps you are going to take for the thorough recovery of your health.
MusicBO;4;3158;In that manner I must try (D.V.) to produce something myself and in my own way which will once more restore freshness and artistic conscientiousness to me.
MusicBO;4;3246;If both are able this autumn to perform the Swiss journey, which they missed last year, I shall of course stay with them at the Hotel Baur.
MusicBO;4;3439;"Let me confess to you that I have scarcely been able to look at the marvellous new buildings erected here; all this is so strange to me"
MusicBO;4;3841;In the worst case, my view would simply be an erroneous one, but you should not misunderstand or disapprove of my intention of saving you unnecessary trouble.
MusicBO;4;4104;His musical gift appears very considerable to me, and I have advised him to concentrate himself on an operatic subject, which he had better arrange for himself.
MusicBO;4;4249;I hope in the meantime that this lengthy explanation and disclosure of the misunderstanding into which you had succeeded in falling will be some comfort to you.
MusicBO;4;4325;I was advised to submit to that condition, but after mature consideration, and after weighing all the chances, I am firmly resolved never to fulfil that condition.
MusicBO;4;5107;It is not customary for the ministry to transmit private messages, and you therefore must either call on M. Leree personally, or send him a few lines.
MusicBO;4;5166;I thank you for the gentle manner in which you reply to my proposal, and take into account the narrow circumstances and resources which impede my activity.
MusicBO;4;17;If you have to write to Leipzig show yourself, to please me, friendly and appreciative of their goodwill, and of the success which cannot be denied.
MusicBO;4;505;"DEAR SIR, I have the honour to return the following answer to your question as to the ""conditions"" of the performance of Wagner's operas in Berlin:—"
MusicBO;4;1963;"I have not yet gone out into the air; but I am getting accustomed to my room, and do not particularly long for our autumn mists."
MusicBO;4;2081;I brought home so dreadful a cold that I had to go to bed for a few days, and to delay my journey till this evening.
MusicBO;4;2362;From the balcony I have the most divine view of the whole Mont Blanc range, and from the door I step into a pretty little garden.
MusicBO;4;2453;I may confess this to you, because you know the infinite self-sacrifice and invincible love which have supported my whole existence for the last eight years.
MusicBO;4;3418;"The essence of the ""world"" proper could never have been expressed more pointedly, more brilliantly, more powerfully and at the same time more destructively, more terribly."
MusicBO;4;3786;I should like much to reply by word of mouth to all you tell me, including your most curious ideas as to my designs on Italy.
MusicBO;4;4184;If you do not think this advisable, I am determined to ask D. whether the Grand Duke of Weimar will intercede for me with another prince.
MusicBO;4;4333;In that manner I think I have taken the only step which may lead me straight to the goal of certain knowledge as to my fate.
MusicBO;4;5149;while I know all the time that we are cordially united and, so to speak, welded together in spirit, I will not explain to you today.
MusicBO;4;322;I tell you this because I think that you will not approve of the plan, and will refuse your consent if asked for the plan.
MusicBO;4;343;Dingelstedt has written me an amiable and encouraging letter, and I have sent him the opera which is to be given there in the summer.
MusicBO;4;429;"Do not be anxious about my indisposition; my indisposition will soon be over, and my legs have to carry me a good way further still."
MusicBO;4;1897;This representation on paper will probably be the only one which my work will achieve, for which reason I linger over the copying with satisfaction.
MusicBO;4;2862;It would be foolish if I tried to arrange my future definitely at this moment, which will probably bring my provisional position to a close.
MusicBO;4;2965;Perhaps you will be able to find an original copy for him, for which Capellmeister Fischer would have to send you the price agreed upon.
MusicBO;4;3004;"But now I am quite satisfied, and if you hear the melting and hammering songs of ""Siegfried"" you will have a new experience of me."
MusicBO;4;3288;My daughter Blandine has married at Florence, on October 22nd, Emile Ollivier, avocat au barreau de Paris, and democratic deputy for the city of Paris.
MusicBO;4;3481;I informed him that my only and indispensable CONDITION would be that an exact translation of the opera, without omission or alteration, should be given.
MusicBO;4;4181;If you have reasons for not entering into my request, or for declining to concern yourself with it personally, let me know plainly and definitely.
MusicBO;4;4195;Answer me soon definitely and decisively, for I repeat that I do not want my request to be in any way connected with the amnesty.
MusicBO;4;4287;But I will not go to bed today without thanking you most sincerely for the great benefit you have conferred upon me by your letter.
MusicBO;4;4394;I have grown so indifferent to similar impressions, that I often find it very difficult to discover the exact point where the impression is made.
MusicBO;4;5061;All I can do in the face of this is to wait quietly and resignedly, until the King condescends to adopt a more correct view.
MusicBO;4;259;In this way I received another proof of the experience that it is our own fault if we cannot receive what is magnanimously offered.
MusicBO;4;270;What you intended to do here you could not have expressed otherwise than by this tremendous display of eloquence, of emotion, of overpowering strength.
MusicBO;4;473;The whole thing attracts me only because The whole thing gives me an opportunity for an Alpine trip (by the Bernese Oberland to Valais).
MusicBO;4;538;"In five or six days I shall visit Joachim at Hanover; Joachim was here all last week, and showed me a very remarkable overture."
MusicBO;4;581;I told him that I would let you know, and that I was convinced you would send me a copy for him if possible.
MusicBO;4;959;Today I was asked, on the part of the Philharmonic Society of London, whether I should be inclined to conduct its concerts this year.
MusicBO;4;1062;If you have succeeded in making the middle part a little more pliable, this work, significant as it was before, must have gained considerably.
MusicBO;4;1342;My annoyance at being compelled to produce such trifling specimens of my work and to have my whole being judged thereby is too great.
MusicBO;4;1476;If I look forward to anything in the future as pure happiness, it is my becoming acquainted through your means with your new compositions.
MusicBO;4;1661;The musicians rose solemnly, and together with the whole thickly packed hall, began a storm of applause so continuous that I really felt awkward.
MusicBO;4;1673;"In that manner I gained a deep sympathy for my new friend; he appeared to me quite different from what he had done before."
MusicBO;4;1765;The Princess and her daughter stayed several weeks at Berlin, and for the last week The Princess and her daughter have been in Paris.
MusicBO;4;1812;"Johanna Wagner arrived here the day before yesterday, and ""Wagner and her parents will stay a week in Weymar with her sister, Frau Ritter."
MusicBO;4;2342;I could not help laughing when the excellent Princess, with much sorrow and sympathy, announced the impending arrival of the M. family at Zurich.
MusicBO;4;2810;"In such circumstances, my only hope is the speedy success of the Hartel affair in connection with the ""Nibelungen,"" which had been broken off."
MusicBO;4;3391;, I write only to tell you that I have arrived at Paris, and that my address is Grand Hotel du Louvre (No. 364).
MusicBO;4;3475;To sum up, the Hartels accept, in spite of their great doubts, the publication of the work, with a reduction, however, of my demands.
MusicBO;4;4376;The hope you give me of receiving frequent visits from you in Paris is the real bright point in the picture of the future.
MusicBO;4;4558;Nevertheless, write to me some particulars about the offer which has been made to you, without the slightest fear of alarming the German Confederacy.
MusicBO;4;4708;Why do you all of a sudden object to Paris, where, if you do not wish it, no one need know of your presence?
MusicBO;4;4717;By the spontaneous joy and cordiality with which I should have received her, the Princess would have recognized what the Princess is to me.
MusicBO;4;4740;Be always assured that you are dear to me above all else, even if I fail to comprehend many things which determine your action.
MusicBO;4;5023;Least of all am I inclined to discover the cause of your irritation in the stupid reception which your works have met with now
MusicBO;4;401;He had studied the part thoroughly at numerous performances, both here and at Leipzig, and therefore sang the music with absolute certainty. 
MusicBO;4;421;I know several young men who would willingly try, but several young men who would willingly try are not sufficiently skilful and competent.
MusicBO;4;609;May Heaven grant that you may be sufficiently recovered to do a foolish thing and tempt others to a foolish thing as well.
MusicBO;4;835;I am almost inclined to believe the latter, and to hope in consequence that you will soon be able to announce our triumph.
MusicBO;4;882;Can you make arrangements so that my offer may be readily met, and that my programme may be translated into French and Dutch?
MusicBO;4;1021;I was at first startled at your new year's article, but soon perceived that here again I am indebted to your ever-increasing sympathy.
MusicBO;4;1263;The only interesting thing to me is the orchestra, which has taken a great liking to me, and believes in me with enthusiasm.
MusicBO;4;1557;"When I look back upon your activity in these last years, you appear superhuman to me; there is something very strange about this."
MusicBO;4;1670;One real gain I bring back from England—the cordial and genuine friendship which I feel for Berlioz, and which we have mutually concluded.
MusicBO;4;2690;Lachner succeeded, in my opinion, better than the public here seemed to think, which is, as a rule, somewhat lukewarm and stolid. 
MusicBO;4;2703;I thanked him politely for the distinction intended for me, and reserved to myself the permission of making use of it another time.
MusicBO;4;2861;As I have given up the allowance of the R.'s, it is important for me to settle my income on an INDEPENDENT basis.
MusicBO;4;2923;Receive my most cordial thanks, and let it be a joy to you to have given me so much and such heartfelt joy.
MusicBO;4;3011;A description of your single poems I had to refrain from altogether, for the reason which I candidly state in the letter itself.
MusicBO;4;3577;I have to thank you very much for your last letter, to which I thought, upon the whole, silence was the best answer.
MusicBO;4;3626;My anxiety about her was terrible, and for two months I had to expect the news of her death from day to day.
MusicBO;4;3666;I should not know what to think of this young man, who speaks of God and the world in the most ruthless manner.
MusicBO;4;3811;Unfortunately I could not prevent my landlord from trumpeting about my stay here, which in consequence was made public sooner than I desired.
MusicBO;4;4152;I fear that even you do not quite understand me in this respect, and you should believe my word all the more implicitly.
MusicBO;4;4193;This letter, dear Franz is addressed to you, and deals with a subject which will be of decisive influence on my future life.
MusicBO;4;4354;Even now you do not state those motives plainly, for the reason apparently that you fear to wound me unnecessarily by their communication.
MusicBO;4;4614;I am probably taken for an obstinate conspirator, an opinion which the treatment I receive at the hands of Germany seems to countenance.
MusicBO;4;4715;It is just this sacrifice which appears to me too great at the price of a few hurried days in a Strassburg hotel.
MusicBO;4;4833;"You know for what reasons I did not, at the time, beg ""Tristan"" for Weymar, and you will approve of my passive attitude."
MusicBO;4;4905;"D. showed me your letter about ""Rienzi"", and I am thankful to you for having behaved in so accommodating and generous a manner."
MusicBO;4;4938;At last I find time and the proper mood for writing to you in a more collected manner than is usually the case.
MusicBO;4;4954;"You are quite mistaken, however, in thinking that a ""special occasion"" would be necessary for inducing me to pay a visit to Weimar."
MusicBO;4;5167;You cannot believe how painful it is to me not to be able to do anything PROPER for your honour, benefit, and use.
MusicBO;4;148;On that account I latterly again felt the liveliest desire to obtain my amnesty, and thus to gain free access to Germany.
MusicBO;4;244;I have no longer any feeling for that kind of thing, and could not produce that kind of thing at any price.
MusicBO;4;276;I suspect, however, that the public heard correctly what was sung, and therefore could of course not understand the matter at all.
MusicBO;4;315;Today I only want to tell you that on the day of the performance of the opera by the Duke of Gotha
MusicBO;4;399;On the first occasion the house was illuminated, because the Grand Duchess visited the theatre for the first time since her confinement.
MusicBO;4;558;In the same manner, the exceptional successes of Spontini's and Meyerbeer's own operas were enhanced by the special activity of their composers.
MusicBO;4;974;The offer of the Philharmonic Society is very acceptable, and your friends will be pleased with The offer of the Philharmonic Society.
MusicBO;4;1068;I am as yet uncertain whether I shall publish the nine pieces together or these two numbers (3 and 4) in advance.
MusicBO;4;1076;"We talked about this at Weymar in the year 1849; and, in my opinion, the enterprise can be made to succeed completely."
MusicBO;4;1264;By that means I shall at least be able to have a few good performances, to which the people are quite unaccustomed.
MusicBO;4;1327;Should I have the impudence to write to him and to try in my own way what seems impossible in any other?
MusicBO;4;2334;"The copy of the full score of the ""Rhinegold"" I expect back from Klindworth before long, and shall send it to you.)"
MusicBO;4;2733;I have therefore but one desire, that of being able to visit you when I wish, and of living with you periodically.
MusicBO;4;2989;"My writing-table stands at the large window, with a splendid view of the lake and the Alps; rest and quiet surround me."
MusicBO;4;2996;I am astonished myself at having achieved this, for at our last meeting I again appeared to myself a terribly blundering musician.
MusicBO;4;3094;Owing to the severe illness of the Princess, my frame of mind has been sad and anxious for more than nine weeks.
MusicBO;4;3372;Send me the money, and let me know at the same time where you can meet me, at Strassburg or in Paris.
MusicBO;4;3399;How can I be unhappy, when I have attained the supreme happiness of possessing such a friend, of participating in such love?
MusicBO;4;3408;I was permitted to feel the delight of becoming acquainted with such a poet as Calderon in my mature stage of life.
MusicBO;4;3413;I can unfortunately approach him through a translation only on account of my great want of gift for languages (as for music).
MusicBO;4;3460;This grieves me very much, and I am afraid that a serious conflict between myself and the management will be the result.
MusicBO;4;3714;I feel the necessity of living in strict seclusion for some considerable period, in order to devote myself entirely to my work.
MusicBO;4;3847;As you failed to do so, I came to a conclusion which I am only too happy to abandon on your word.
MusicBO;4;4123;"I send you this week's repertoire of the Weymar theatre, in which you will see the announcement of ""Lohengrin"" for next Sunday."
MusicBO;4;4290;I shall say more about this tomorrow, and you will find me in a willing frame of mind for confessing my sins.
MusicBO;4;4554;"Let us bear our cross together in Christ—""the God whom one approaches without pride, before whom one bends the knee without despair."
MusicBO;4;4847;I do not want to encroach upon you, but what you can do without injuring yourself, do please, as soon as possible.
MusicBO;4;4912;"From the Princess I continue to have very good news; the Princess will probably remain in Rome for some time to come."
MusicBO;4;4924;Nevertheless, I think it preferable to wait for an opportunity more favourable to both of us, which, I hope, will occur soon.
MusicBO;4;4947;These various motives I developed into the plan of a very short tour to the Rhine, such as suited my limited finances.
MusicBO;4;159;"I can do nothing, except create my ""Nibelungen""; and even that I am unable to do without great and energetic help."
MusicBO;4;255;At the same time, there was something in these details which seemed to strike me in spite of my unsympathetic mood.
MusicBO;4;292;It is true that it may seem absurd that I am going to keep a secretary, who can scarcely keep myself.
MusicBO;4;363;"And ""off and on"" we should be sure to undertake something to give vent to our energies in the outer world."
MusicBO;4;528;The arrangement with Dingelstedt has not as yet been settled, but Dingelstedt is coming to Weymar at the end of June.
MusicBO;4;1230;"I can imagine how the invitation has pleased you; and I too am pleased and most curious to see your work."
MusicBO;4;1544;I have advised H. to settle in Berlin, where his position at the music school will be very useful to him.
MusicBO;4;1581;Before all, I cordially agreed with him in his praise of the saints who had chosen poverty of their own free-will.
MusicBO;4;2046;I was just going to write something in the album, so that the Child might have it for the new year.
MusicBO;4;2133;I should have to engage my amanuensis for exactly three years, and pay him an annual salary of eight hundred francs.
MusicBO;4;2178;DEAREST RICHARD, At last I am able to tell you that you will receive one thousand francs at the BEGINNING of
MusicBO;4;2353;I had foreseen all this, and therefore during Tichatschek's stay of twelve days, was in a state of continual, painful anxiety.
MusicBO;4;2490;I read one or other of the scores every day, just as I might read a poem, fluently and without stopping.
MusicBO;4;2899;"A new opera, never yet performed, by a Belgian composer, M. Lassen, ""Landgraf Ludwig's Brautfahrt,"" will be put in rehearsal soon."
MusicBO;4;2985;For ten days we lived at the hotel, and at last we moved in here in very cold and terrible weather.
MusicBO;4;3076;I have, therefore, invited them to come here this summer, and to meet Klindworth, who has announced his visit to me.
MusicBO;4;3084;Let me know, at least, by some sign, how you are, and whether you forgive me for my anxiety about you.
MusicBO;4;3602;When H. R. H. came into my room, one fine morning, bringing your letter, I shook you cordially by the hand.
MusicBO;4;3893;If Eduard Devrient's can arrange to get me permission to go to Carlsruhe for the performance, it will take place there.
MusicBO;4;4274;I must ask you to believe that I am extremely grieved always to have to tell you things of this kind.
MusicBO;4;4524;What we are to each other we know and tell one another at intervals for the sake of encouragement and comfort.
MusicBO;4;4626;we are miserable creatures, and the few who have penetrated the deepest secrets of life are the most miserable of all.
MusicBO;4;4730;I can complain no longer, for that would mean to accuse, and I do not even want to accuse friend Devrient.
MusicBO;4;5075;I am extremely pleased, for I confess that I think it no easy task to Frenchify your works in your sense.
MusicBO;4;5150;You have probably heard of the painful circumstances which prevented me from visiting you in Paris at the end of February.
MusicBO;4;5156;I hope that you will credit me with sufficient knowledge of the circumstance to understand your hesitation at sanctioning this proceeding.
MusicBO;4;980;In the meantime let me know something more about this Philharmonic business, which will probably turn out to your satisfaction.
MusicBO;4;1277;I anticipated this all along, although, for my part, I could not and did not wish to bring it about.
MusicBO;4;1295;His cousin, a very amiable lady, will shortly bring you news of Weymar, where she has been staying several months.
MusicBO;4;1420;Forgive me for asking you this small thing—small in its material aspect, but great as the world in its significance.
MusicBO;4;1636;The normal vulgarity of man and the license of general egoism further distort the image until it becomes a caricature.
MusicBO;4;1757;It will be necessary, however, that you should write to him a few lines direct, in which please mention me.
MusicBO;4;1808;With Mason Brothers I have some connection through William Mason, one of my pupils, who lived eighteen months in Weymar.
MusicBO;4;2275;To satisfy me completely, and give me a chance of success, this could only be done by you, dear Franz.
MusicBO;4;2656;Everywhere I discover secrets which had been previously hidden from me, and everything in consequence grows more passionate, more impulsive.
MusicBO;4;2762;A thousand thanks to the most excellent Princess for the most astonishing cushion, and especially for the famous German letter.
MusicBO;4;2772;I am sure you will be good enough to do all in your power to set my mind at rest.
MusicBO;4;2831;, I must once more trouble you with something which this time will not be altogether without interest to you.
MusicBO;4;2925;The essential thing is that you love me, and consider my honest efforts as a musician worthy of your sympathy.
MusicBO;4;2946;Once more, my best, best thanks for today, when I did not want to write to you about anything else.
MusicBO;4;3102;I hope I shall be able to visit you in the autumn, after the Jubilee of Grand Duke Carl August.
MusicBO;4;3480;"He asked me to authorise him to take the necessary steps for the performance of ""Tannhauser"" at the Grand Opera."
MusicBO;4;3718;"But in large towns the noise of carriages is absolutely unbearable to me; the noise of carriages drives me wild."
MusicBO;4;3726;This is indispensable for my future, for such a permission would permanently open to me Venice and Austrian Italy generally.
MusicBO;4;3758;Even the performance of your operas at Vienna is an example of exceptional toleration, considering the customs of the country.
MusicBO;4;3813;Whether this was the result of the intercession of the Grand Duke, for which I had asked, I cannot tell.
MusicBO;4;4025;I cannot tell you how comic it appears to me that I have to transact Weimar business with F. D.
MusicBO;4;4340;It will depend upon the consent of the Grand Duke of Baden whether I take further steps in that direction.
MusicBO;4;4805;But I must not think of this for the present, although I shall certainly come as soon as I can.
MusicBO;4;4993;This I have done, and I hope that the opus will appear about the beginning of October at the latest.
MusicBO;4;5079;Cordial thanks for your kind letter, which in these dreary days has been a great and noble joy to me.
MusicBO;4;5137;I have not been able yet to address a single line to my Leipzig publisher in connection with this matter.
MusicBO;4;168;To YOU alone can I explain how painfully I am placed, and how necessary immediate help is to me.
MusicBO;4;224;This is as yet a secret, which I, for my part, should like to see made public very soon.
MusicBO;4;1125;I expect it in a few days, and shall send it you at once, together with a proper letter.
MusicBO;4;1171;Be kind enough therefore to tell me in your next letter the street and the number of the house.
MusicBO;4;1234;In that manner everything is disclosed to me at once that otherwise I have to disclose to myself painfully.
MusicBO;4;1241;In this manner I deprived myself of the pleasure of seeing them once more, which grieves me very much.
MusicBO;4;1261;The truth is that in this manner you will avoid a struggle which, in my opinion, would be fruitless.
MusicBO;4;1650;I have been back in Zurich since June 3Oth, after having conducted my last London concert on the 25th.
MusicBO;4;1706;Berlioz is splendid in his ardour and warmth of heart, and I confess that even his violence delights me.
MusicBO;4;1784;All the motive power which, for a time, I derived from my dreary solitude is gradually losing its force.
MusicBO;4;2189;I can tell you nothing until I know when the consecration of the Gran cathedral is to take place.
MusicBO;4;2756;Your Munich news showed you to me in your ever serene artistic element, which I cordially enjoyed with you.
MusicBO;4;2821;At this moment, when I am most in need of help, I want to know DEFINITELY how matters stand.
MusicBO;4;2838;I have not yet got back to the mood for writing to the kind Princess and the good Child.
MusicBO;4;2998;"With a local prima-donna, whom you heard in ""La Juive"", I studied the great final scene of the ""Valkyrie."
MusicBO;4;3214;This much I see, that I must, once more, perform a little miracle to make people believe in me.
MusicBO;4;3261;You wrote to me a few lines, but not a word as to whether you were coming or not.
MusicBO;4;3294;"I want you to receive these lines just as you are going to the first performance of your ""Dante."
MusicBO;4;3800;I am in quest of repose and absolute retirement, such as only a larger town can offer to me.
MusicBO;4;4094;What can I tell you about it beyond saying that I feel with you in my heart of hearts!
MusicBO;4;4308;I could think of nothing better than to copy out for you a few fragments of my last work.
MusicBO;4;4343;I must no longer delay gaining that certainty, because my whole future life depends upon my whole future life.
MusicBO;4;4566;I hope the weather will soon be finer on the lake, and a milder spirit will illumine your soul.
MusicBO;4;4654;If you should happen to remain in Switzerland till after that, I shall visit you in the late autumn.
MusicBO;4;4714;You must pardon me for declining the Strassburg meeting, greatly as I appreciate the sacrifice which you offer me.
MusicBO;4;4988;I take great delight in the re-writing of the great Venus scene, and hope to improve the effect thereby.
MusicBO;4;5011;"X. seems to be angry with me; I at last got annoyed with him because his optimism irritated me."
MusicBO;4;5106;You will receive the little parcel from Monsieur Leree, chef de bureau des departs au ministere des affaires etrangeres.
MusicBO;4;5128;Guess at my condition from this fact, and forgive me anything that I may have done to shock you.
MusicBO;4;6;The second and third acts, however, suffered much from the faults and shortcomings of both chorus and principals.
MusicBO;4;80;No one will undertake such an affair unless No one has personal confidence in my future (?) successes.
MusicBO;4;435;But I begin to feel that the best remedy for our sufferings is sympathy with those of others.
MusicBO;4;677;I have no money for roaming about, and while I am enjoying my work nothing else attracts me.
MusicBO;4;1113;I am looking forward to it with immense pleasure, and shall use it for learning English after all.
MusicBO;4;1698;Welcome in Zurich, dearest Richard, where I hope to see you at the end of September or October.
MusicBO;4;1768;One of these days you will receive from Bussenius, with whom you were in correspondence before, your biography.
MusicBO;4;1781;In my present condition, however, I have little hope of gaining much work by this gain of time.
MusicBO;4;2040;That amiable intention I want to forestall by a few performances under my own direction during the winter.
MusicBO;4;2256;She has written me a very cheerful and friendly letter, for which I am deeply obliged to her.
MusicBO;4;2488;I expect then to see you crowned with glory on your return from the land of your fathers.
MusicBO;4;2607;There you will be able to rest a little more comfortably than at the Hecht of St. Gallen.
MusicBO;4;2658;However, I must think that I am doing all this for myself, in order to pass the days.
MusicBO;4;2660;You may believe me or not, I have no other desire than that of coming to you soon.
MusicBO;4;3074;As it is, I am compelled to try everything, so as to tempt the Hartels to this purchase.
MusicBO;4;3176;But I have made these complaints a thousand times, and there is no help for a thousand times.
MusicBO;4;3478;This time, however, I want to give you a short synopsis of the state of my Paris expedition.
MusicBO;4;3627;Her health was ruined, especially by the immoderate use of opium, taken nominally as a remedy for sleeplessness.
MusicBO;4;3681;But for that very reason I expect him to be a good and steady fellow in all respects.
MusicBO;4;3711;It somewhat startled me, and I made inquiries through a friend in Berne of the Austrian minister there.
MusicBO;4;3802;Your warnings and admonitions not to rely on the performance of my operas in Italy I pass over.
MusicBO;4;3980;At first when I thought that the score would be finished this autumn, I prodded them on terribly.
MusicBO;4;4064;You enlightened me upon this point last winter, when you explained to me the reason for its delay.
MusicBO;4;4081;Imagine that for a week and a half I have not been able to move from my chair.
MusicBO;4;4141;I must, in fact, undergo an absolute change in order to gain a position more worthy of myself.
MusicBO;4;4209;As this part of my letter has remained obscure to you, I add the following words of explanation.
MusicBO;4;4533;I flatter her and take care of her as if my wife were a bride in her honeymoon.
MusicBO;4;4786;This consideration is to me, at least, the only one which sometimes puts me in a tolerable mood.
MusicBO;4;4876;The G. D. is not here, and no other course is open until the performance actually takes place.
MusicBO;4;4958;Be assured that I am joyfully looking forward to the day when I may set sail for Altenburg.
MusicBO;4;4975;For the present my Paris enterprise occupies me altogether, and mercifully obscures my view of future German misery.
MusicBO;4;5082;What a blessing it is to be able to dispense with the explanation and discussion of certain things!
MusicBO;4;5206;Briefly speaking, my situation is indicated by this dilemma: Either my marriage takes place, and that soon—or not.
MusicBO;4;93;"The only thing I want is money; that at least one ought to be able to get."
MusicBO;4;149;In that case I might at least be active in helping on the performances of my operas.
MusicBO;4;335;You may do this in MY NAME, and mention at the same time that I have ONCE
MusicBO;4;338;I think this would be a good opportunity of bringing the Berlin affair to a satisfactory conclusion.
MusicBO;4;370;"I shall soon have to write again; I have more materials than I can deal with today."
MusicBO;4;439;But if you do feel such a want, then esteem me worthy of listening to your grief.
MusicBO;4;838;Let us not attempt to look upon the matter in any serious light except as regards money.
MusicBO;4;883;If you can answer these questions satisfactorily, kindly take the matter in hand as soon as possible.
MusicBO;4;1020;"but I shall not publish eine Last, Der Tod erwunscht, das Leben mir verhasst!"" in any case."
MusicBO;4;1108;My complaint that you seldom ANSWER me in the proper sense of the word you have misunderstood.
MusicBO;4;1432;"I am compelled to conduct an English concert programme right down to the end; that says everything."
MusicBO;4;1441;And even if all this were better than it is, what business have I with such concerts?
MusicBO;4;1531;Therefore use time and patience in correcting, and where necessary let the plates be engraved over again.
MusicBO;4;1721;The end of last week I spent in Dresden, where I called upon our friends, the Ritters.
MusicBO;4;1835;"As it has been delayed so long, I should almost like to finish the whole ""Valkyrie"" previously."
MusicBO;4;1902;Must I assure you once more, that I look forward to our meeting with a sacred awe!
MusicBO;4;2258;Write to me soon and at some length, as we are not going to meet just yet.
MusicBO;4;2302;"Perhaps you might on the same occasion hand a copy of my ""Nibelungen"" poem to the King."
MusicBO;4;2507;the necessary money also bind themselves to publish the whole in 1859, the year of the performance.
MusicBO;4;2652;From her daughter I soon expect a letter, as we have promised to correspond with each other.
MusicBO;4;2870;However, as I remarked before, I must be satisfied even if they give me a little less.
MusicBO;4;2873;ALTOGETHER, for I have made up my mind henceforth to preserve my independence as much as possible.
MusicBO;4;2918;I live in the greatest retirement, and do as much work as my health will let me.
MusicBO;4;3179;These are the kind of people who continually trouble themselves about me with astounding faithfulness and constancy.
MusicBO;4;3225;You have certainly many reasons for being bitter, and if I generally observe silence on the point
MusicBO;4;3290;I wish I could live with you on the Lake of Zurich, and go on writing quietly.
MusicBO;4;3316;Above all other wishes is my wish of seeing you and enjoying you to my heart's content.
MusicBO;4;3332;"I want to tell you, however, that yesterday, at last, I finished the first act of ""Tristan."
MusicBO;4;3425;By the side of this marvellously significant phenomenon, all other national literatures appear to me without importance.
MusicBO;4;3631;Thus I have to undertake new duties, over which I must try to forget my own sufferings.
MusicBO;4;3642;You can imagine how often I am with you, especially when Tausig is sitting at the piano.
MusicBO;4;3760;Your POLITICAL expectations in Austria are as small as are your ARTISTIC expectations in Paris and Italy.
MusicBO;4;4065;But I do not desire that you should force this juvenile production upon any one in Weimar.
MusicBO;4;4084;However, I am getting better, and hope to be able to walk and work again next week.
MusicBO;4;4177;It would not help me radically, and would therefore imply all the dangers of a palliative measure.
MusicBO;4;4424;At our next meeting I shall have to say much about it, unfortunately of the negative kind.
MusicBO;4;4428;I stay here till Easter, and then go on a visit to Prince Hohenzollern at Lowenberg, Silesia.
MusicBO;4;4773;I have to thank you for the most pleasant acquaintance which you procure to me so unexpectedly
MusicBO;4;4827;"Let me know when convenient what you consider most desirable in regard to the performance of ""Tristan."
MusicBO;4;4915;As soon as I have an opportunity I shall send you my medley of songs to Paris.
MusicBO;4;4965;This is all the more evident, as the condition of our largest operatic theatres is most disappointing.
MusicBO;4;5068;We had, of course, to adapt some things too true in themselves to our laudable habits here.
MusicBO;4;5204;Many objections have of course been raised, which, however, have not been able to alter my resolution.
MusicBO;4;113;The present of the Princess caused me a smile,—a smile over which I could shed tears.
MusicBO;4;143;This WORK is truly the only thing which still ties me to the desire of life.
MusicBO;4;237;I mean, I was not in the mood for a somewhat adverse judge of this composition.
MusicBO;4;405;The newspapers announce that you are going to conduct the impending Musical Festival in Canton Valais.
MusicBO;4;602;Your question about the Musical Festival has given me hopes that you might accompany me there.
MusicBO;4;643;I often feel sorry that things around me do not seem to tend in that direction.
MusicBO;4;676;I am going to Canton Valais in a few days, but intend to be back soon.
MusicBO;4;787;After the Rotterdam festival I stayed a few days at Brussels to meet my two daughters.
MusicBO;4;805;I feel humiliated before myself, because I seek in vain release from this grief of self-reproach.
MusicBO;4;841;And do you know what has confirmed me in this sentiment, inspiring me with new pride?
MusicBO;4;886;If I could bring back money from Belgium and Holland, I might probably resume my work.
MusicBO;4;941;"Your cheering words about the ""Rhinegold"" were splendid, and the ""Rhinegold"" has really turned out well."
MusicBO;4;1148;From Hamburg also I hear that the public are gradually being educated up to the public.
MusicBO;4;1378;Ah, could you soon be with me wholly and bodily, then we might support life beautifully.
MusicBO;4;1425;Cordial thanks, dearest Franz, for your kind note, which I had been expecting a long time.
MusicBO;4;1502;Be not angry therefore if I ask you to set the matter completely right when convenient.
MusicBO;4;1510;I need not tell YOU anything about it, and I am not much the wiser myself.
MusicBO;4;1534;"Whatever may happen, and however it may happen, I implore you to ""Hold out and persevere."
MusicBO;4;1562;But what astonishes me and appears worthy of envy is that you can create so much.
MusicBO;4;1676;We remained together till three o'clock in the morning, and took leave with the warmest embraces.
MusicBO;4;1723;His mother-in-law has been staying here for some weeks, and Johanna Wagner is expected in September.
MusicBO;4;1769;It has been written with the best intentions, and will probably be read far and wide.
MusicBO;4;1838;I am quite unable to deal with this work on the piano to my own satisfaction.
MusicBO;4;1861;I believe if I had such an instrument I should still learn to play the piano.
MusicBO;4;2048;"I write to you only to tell you so; a real letter I could not accomplish."
MusicBO;4;2286;I should not even insist upon conducting the performance of any of my operas in person.
MusicBO;4;2327;Unfortunately it is only with great difficulty that I can gain a clear conception of them.
MusicBO;4;2335;I am going to take a purgative in order to avoid the return of my illness.
MusicBO;4;2389;That is why you are so fortunate in being able to do this with supreme excellence.
MusicBO;4;2452;It is true I am happy, as happy as a child of this earth can be.
MusicBO;4;2511;In any case, if I want the money, I must enable them to take actual possession.
MusicBO;4;2567;"Try, first of all, to get quite well; the other ARRANGEMENTS will come in due course."
MusicBO;4;2764;"To the good Child I shall write shortly; continue to love me all three of you."
MusicBO;4;3104;In reference to the Hartel affair I enclose his two letters of March 4th and 5th.
MusicBO;4;3199;His wife, who lives at Weimar, will, no doubt, gladly undertake to send him the score.
MusicBO;4;3307;We wear ourselves out thereby, and do not expect to receive love and comprehension in return.
MusicBO;4;3359;DEAREST FRANZ, I intend to go to Paris in order to look after my interests there.
MusicBO;4;3424;Yea, the most graceful, most humorous creations were given to the light from that ghostly refuge.
MusicBO;4;3548;From Dresden nothing much can be expected as yet, but I shall make another attempt soon.
MusicBO;4;3763;(I do not speak of London, where a good GERMAN opera troupe might have a chance.)
MusicBO;4;3794;this raised the hope in me that I should see you and speak to you soon.
MusicBO;4;3903;I hope that these lines will affect you as sympathetically as yours have made me happy.
MusicBO;4;3929;"First of all you will receive a letter concerning ""Rienzi"" from my chief and friend Dingelstedt."
MusicBO;4;4044;I have to indulge in a few shrieks, which in a letter would not sound well.
MusicBO;4;4058;In itself I look upon this revival as an anachronism which, moreover, would be quite premature.
MusicBO;4;4289;"But that state has now disappeared entirely; you took a state of convulsive excitement away today."
MusicBO;4;4349;This seems a princely way of doing things, and the young sovereign inspires me with confidence.
MusicBO;4;4401;, I do not want to go to bed before sending you two words of news.
MusicBO;4;4446;"The weather is bad; I am absolutely alone, and seldom in the right mood for work."
MusicBO;4;4461;, it is the only place in the world which is at present possible to me.
MusicBO;4;4467;"But how if I did not get ""Tristan"" ready because I could not get it ready?"
MusicBO;4;4632;The worst is that we know it quite well, and yet never like to believe it.
MusicBO;4;4700;We live too little together, and must necessarily become strangers in one important aspect of friendship.
MusicBO;4;4704;You say you cannot come to Paris, and propose a two days' meeting at Strassburg instead.
MusicBO;4;4846;At the same time I must declare that I shall not accept less than 1,000 francs.
MusicBO;4;4883;I shall write to you in a few days about several things not connected with business.
MusicBO;4;4909;Madame Kalergi will be the best and most useful intercessor you could employ in this matter.
MusicBO;4;4990;Unfortunately I have not yet been able to begin this necessary work in the proper way.
MusicBO;4;5017;Believe me, that in spite of my Paris surroundings I feel awfully lonely, while of you
MusicBO;4;5045;I think it more probable, however, that I shall pay you a visit in Paris first.
MusicBO;4;5076;I am very curious to see the new version of the Venus scene and the ballet.
MusicBO;4;5093;"I do not possess a SINGLE copy of my poem of ""The Ring of the Nibelung."
MusicBO;4;5198;You will, of course, stay with me at Altenburg, where H. and T. also have quarters.
MusicBO;4;169;This is the first and most indispensable thing to preserve me for my whole future.
MusicBO;4;174;"During my work I frequently felt quite well; the thunderclouds seemed to have cleared away."
MusicBO;4;190;This is a slower way of proceeding, and my head is still a little confused.
MusicBO;4;198;that I think of Dearest Richard constantly and love you from my heart of hearts.
MusicBO;4;199;Latterly my time has been painfully occupied by all manner of business, visits, work, etc.
MusicBO;4;202;"By October the ""Faust"" symphony will be finished, which also will be published soon afterwards."
MusicBO;4;207;You know how delighted I should be if you would let me see the score.
MusicBO;4;240;Imagine then the contradictions which the very choice of the poem necessarily roused within me.
MusicBO;4;268;I at least know nobody who could do something of this kind with such force.
MusicBO;4;321;"I was told that the Konigsberg troupe intended to perform ""Tannhauser"" at Berlin this summer."
MusicBO;4;501;Be kind enough, dear sir, to let me have your answer as soon as possible.
MusicBO;4;867;I have a deadly hatred of all APPEARANCE, of all hope, for it is self-deception.
MusicBO;4;1110;After having been in Paris together, should we not try to meet in London also?
MusicBO;4;1195;"You will have heard of my letter containing my disgraceful decision regarding ""Tannhauser"" in Berlin."
MusicBO;4;1287;Of my life, my hope, my endurance, I have nothing to say that is cheerful….
MusicBO;4;1336;I sincerely regret that I am here, and shall never in my life come again.
MusicBO;4;1396;How, in our wretched conditions, could enthusiasm, love, and art have their true effect? 
MusicBO;4;1637;And I pity the poet who undertakes to restore the original image from this caricature.
MusicBO;4;2153;It is my fault, and I have to suffer for it as vulgarly as possible.
MusicBO;4;2222;Everything here is so delicate, so finely threaded, that it cannot be explained by letter.
MusicBO;4;2391;You are by nature the genuine, happy artist who not only produces, but also represents.
MusicBO;4;2464;Both sang beautifully, and in many passages, especially in the second half, with overpowering beauty.
MusicBO;4;2497;"I sent you yesterday a parcel containing the original scores of ""Rhinegold"" and the ""Valkyrie."
MusicBO;4;2725;You cannot have a similar feeling, because your life is just the opposite of mine.
MusicBO;4;2744;Can this be arranged, and can the possibility of my visit to Weimar be accelerated?
MusicBO;4;2787;I shall probably have a reply, which I will communicate to Franz in due course.
MusicBO;4;2791;As soon as the favourable moment arrives which I expect, I shall write to Franz.
MusicBO;4;3079;"Delight me soon with satisfactory news of you; you know what I mean by this."
MusicBO;4;3089;I feel so well that I can cheerfully go to my work and various occupations.
MusicBO;4;3171;I had to fight a hard and painful battle before I got to this point.
MusicBO;4;3427;And now, dear friend, I must tell you that I am very satisfied with myself.
MusicBO;4;3561;"You are probably in direct correspondence with Eckert concerning the performance of ""Lohengrin"" at Vienna."
MusicBO;4;3620;, this boy is sure to follow me with clearness of mind and remarkable receptivity.
MusicBO;4;3772;"Address your next letter, ""Hotel de Baviere"", Munich, whence it will be forwarded to me."
MusicBO;4;3784;tell you that I am here in order to be able to expect your visit.
MusicBO;4;3840;But you must not charge me with having evolved the whole matter from my imagination.
MusicBO;4;3894;"But of this hope also I do not make a vital question; I can wait."
MusicBO;4;3992;They wrote to me that the reading committee objected to the subject on RELIGIOUS grounds.
MusicBO;4;4069;I shall complete it in any case, for my enthusiasm and strength for such works
MusicBO;4;4077;Even the Weimar receipts would, unfortunately, not have enabled me to repay your 1,000 francs.
MusicBO;4;4302;DEAR FRANZ, To my hurried lines of yesterday I add a more comprehensive letter today.
MusicBO;4;4304;Lately I felt the urgent desire of sending you a word of comfort and sympathy.
MusicBO;4;4321;I am intent at present upon gaining a clear and definite view of my fate.
MusicBO;4;4350;But I must assist him by denying any intention of a journey to Carlsruhe altogether.
MusicBO;4;4570;The twaddle which dulness, triviality, and spite have talked about it is not worth notice.
MusicBO;4;4680;You MUST know me sufficiently to understand this, although we have not lived much together.
MusicBO;4;4699;Believe me, dear Franz, I find it very difficult to give you news of myself.
MusicBO;4;4706;I have nothing to tell you in a hurry, no plans that we need discuss.
MusicBO;4;4734;my wife is a little better, and I hope things will go on tolerably well.
MusicBO;4;4770;You will like him, too, and in that belief I recommend him to your welcome.
MusicBO;4;4843;Can you induce Herr D. to send me a prompt reply to my last letter?
MusicBO;4;4952;Pardon me for having attempted to smuggle, so to speak, our meeting into another plan.
MusicBO;4;5003;With real horror I think of Germany and of my future enterprises in that country.
MusicBO;4;5047;As regards your visit here, I repeat what I have said to you and others.
MusicBO;4;353;I feel aggrieved because you touch upon them always in a very cursory manner.
MusicBO;4;409;I had got so far in my letter when yours was brought to me.
MusicBO;4;420;It is difficult to find the proper individual who could undertake such a task.
MusicBO;4;424;In case my inquiry leads to a favourable result, I will let you know.
MusicBO;4;488;The clean copy of my scores I shall, after all, have to make myself.
MusicBO;4;596;As you know, I have had Roger in my eye for a long time.
MusicBO;4;639;It would indeed be a kind of satire on my situation and my being.
MusicBO;4;963;If I could make a little money without disgrace, I should be pleased enough.
MusicBO;4;978;You will know how to bring life into them and to do something extraordinary.
MusicBO;4;1123;Pardon me, dearest Franz, for writing a few lines to ask you a favour.
MusicBO;4;1186;This task gives me much pleasure, and I hope to produce an edifying work.
MusicBO;4;1223;In any case they ought to send the money here as soon as possible.
MusicBO;4;1456;I have passed through his Inferno, and am now at the gate of Purgatory.
MusicBO;4;1529;Although this may sometimes be inconvenient, I think it best to let it continue.
MusicBO;4;1553;Let me express to you, best of men, my astonishment at your ENORMOUS PRODUCTIVENESS.
MusicBO;4;1604;A very large portion of mankind remains BELOW this NORMAL stage, for in them
MusicBO;4;1642;You will not expect me to add less important things to this important matter.
MusicBO;4;1716;It is a similar process as in sculpture, when the artist works in marble.
MusicBO;4;1796;"Your article about the ""Harold"" symphony was very beautiful, and has warmed my heart."
MusicBO;4;2008;It is as beautiful as love, as the Infinite, as earth and the heavens.
MusicBO;4;2154;Very well, I suffer, but unfortunately I do not even get anything by it.
MusicBO;4;2293;I therefore ask you most fervently, perform this great service of friendship for me.
MusicBO;4;2300;Be good enough then to let me know soon what I had better do.
MusicBO;4;2669;Farewell, and take care to let me have some of your new scores soon.
MusicBO;4;2707;The Munich public is more or less neutral, more observing and listening than sympathetic.
MusicBO;4;2753;Since my return from St. Gallen I have not seen a soul except Herwegh.
MusicBO;4;3045;I do not say anything today on the important point of your failing health.
MusicBO;4;3128;First of all, receive my heartiest congratulations on the good state of your health.
MusicBO;4;3138;You say nothing of the health of her daughter, who was also severely indisposed.
MusicBO;4;3190;REMAIN well, for you say that you are well, and once more, love me.
MusicBO;4;3220;DEAREST RICHARD, At your recommendation I am reading the Correspondence between Schiller and Goethe.
MusicBO;4;3369;I shall therefore require at least one thousand francs in order to get away.
MusicBO;4;3430;At present only the repulsive quality remains, while every charm has lost its power.
MusicBO;4;3542;I hope I shall find time to write you a rational letter from Paris.
MusicBO;4;3564;Of my performances at Prague, Vienna, and Pesth, you have probably heard from others.
MusicBO;4;3593;This was the reason of my business- like haste in finishing this poor work.
MusicBO;4;3661;About this young T. I recently wrote to you in a very unconventional manner.
MusicBO;4;4001;D. wrote to me five and a half lines, inquiring as to my terms.
MusicBO;4;4351;You will therefore oblige me, dearest Franz, by ostensibly assisting me in this matter.
MusicBO;4;4488;which, considering the friendly sympathy of the German Confederacy, I cannot very well neglect.
MusicBO;4;4503;I know, in the depth of my heart, that I am an absolute blunderer.
MusicBO;4;5010;This is fortunate, because the Mayence garrison has certainly not inspired me with enthusiasm.
MusicBO;4;5052;I must in this, as in other matters, show myself resigned, determined, and consistent.
MusicBO;4;5177;What will become of me in the course of this year is quite uncertain.
MusicBO;4;86;Help me over this, and I will undertake once more to hold out.
MusicBO;4;104;Do not think that the news of Leipzig has made me suddenly desperate.
MusicBO;4;257;In fact, I imbibed it in a manner with the most fortunate results.
MusicBO;4;638;"As regards ""success"" in X.'s practical sense, I shall probably never have it."
MusicBO;4;737;It is a fine thing of you to have understood them so well.
MusicBO;4;749;Give us that alms frequently, because you are none the poorer for it.
MusicBO;4;751;It may go slowly, but it will go WELL and, before all, DECENTLY.
MusicBO;4;837;"This is the only real point; all the rest is, and remains, fictitious."
MusicBO;4;839;I should despise myself if I paid any attention to anything beyond this.
MusicBO;4;865;That sentiment alone gives me strength to drag on the burden of life.
MusicBO;4;906;It is a great pity that I did not see you this year.
MusicBO;4;1046;This negative measure, which I had kept in reserve, will probably be effective.
MusicBO;4;1518;I, on my part, shall furnish a kind of commentary to his work.
MusicBO;4;1850;It is a blessing that they do not offer me very much money.
MusicBO;4;1903;As far as we require society, it will not be unpleasant this time.
MusicBO;4;1947;About the middle of November I shall send you a parcel of them.
MusicBO;4;2056;This was the most wholesome mud that had ever been thrown at me.
MusicBO;4;2155;Could I only bring back the state of things of four years ago!
MusicBO;4;2221;About this also I feel the absolute necessity of personal communication with you.
MusicBO;4;2224;The reason is that delusive possibilities of escape continually haunt my troubled imagination.
MusicBO;4;2230;I certainly cannot go on paying for the copying with my own money.
MusicBO;4;2321;I shall have to tell you many things about her when we meet.
MusicBO;4;2404;I hope I shall have the necessary leisure and sufficient lucidity of expression.
MusicBO;4;2438;The consecration of Gran cathedral is fixed for August 31st, and in case
MusicBO;4;2597;The hardest thing was that I had to miss the organ concert yesterday.
MusicBO;4;2620;My aesthetic efforts will, I hope, cure my moral prostration to some extent.
MusicBO;4;2692;"Kindermann's"" voice is splendid, but there is no trace of ""Wolfram"" about him."
MusicBO;4;2750;Let me express my sincere regret at giving you again care and anxiety.
MusicBO;4;2761;Probably there was nothing pleasant to tell, and you remained silent in consequence.
MusicBO;4;3336;Heaven forbid that in that case I should remind you of H. Nageli.
MusicBO;4;3410;"and I have just finished reading ""Apollo and Klymene,"" with its continuation ""Phaeton."
MusicBO;4;3443;"What this possible ""attainment"" may be I can only briefly indicate to you."
MusicBO;4;3490;Here you have plenty of business, but I must add one thing more.
MusicBO;4;3596;I did not think it proper to charge him with such a message.
MusicBO;4;3604;I am astonished, alternately, by his highly developed intellect and his wild ways.
MusicBO;4;3716;One of the interesting, large cities of Italy is exactly what I want.
MusicBO;4;3756;From Austria you cannot expect much for the recovery of your personal liberty.
MusicBO;4;3757;It would be half a miracle if anything of the kind should happen.
MusicBO;4;3788;A thousand greetings from Your R. W. CANAL GRANDE, PALAZZO GIUSTINIANI, CAMPIELLO SQUILLINI,
MusicBO;4;3873;Write to me at Weymar how you like the city of the Lagunes.

MusicBO;4;4093;What must you have felt while you created and formed this wondrous work?
MusicBO;4;4115;Later on you will probably have to write a few lines in reply.
MusicBO;4;4242;Your letter, received today, has affected me deeply, as you will easily understand.
MusicBO;4;4315;, I feel, nevertheless, that I must have cut a very ugly figure.
MusicBO;4;4481;I am curious, however, what will become of my intended migration to Paris.

MusicBO;4;4782;Well, you have now a good insight into the joy of my existence.
MusicBO;4;4987;I am removing such weak points as I have discovered in the score.
MusicBO;4;5053;"I quite agree with what you say of the ""INSUFFICIENT artistic doings"" here"
MusicBO;4;5108;I was in bed a whole week at the same time as you.
MusicBO;4;5134;I also found the copy impossible to send you the book before this

MusicBO;4;1104;Cordial thanks for your pieces of advice, which have my full approval.
MusicBO;4;1117;I shall stay with him till I have found a convenient lodging.
MusicBO;4;1154;I shall soon write again, and also hope to hear from you.
MusicBO;4;1231;But when shall I see something of all this, you reticent person?
MusicBO;4;1265;All other things, especially public, press, etc., are very indifferent to me.
MusicBO;4;1398;I am very grateful to you for being so kind to Klindworth.
MusicBO;4;1431;It is the consistent outgrowth of the greatest inconsistency I ever committed.
MusicBO;4;1461;I do not deny that I should like to meet Beatrice there.

MusicBO;4;2449;I shall tell you what I have heard when I see you.
MusicBO;4;2676;In the orchestra the wind (especially flutes, clarinets, and bassoon) is excellent.
MusicBO;4;2732;I never had this feeling more vividly than since our last meeting.

MusicBO;4;2823;In short, I want to know WHERE to look for my friends.
MusicBO;4;2949;"I wish I could sing in F and E major ""A wonder!"

MusicBO;4;3521;I cannot tell you how deeply the work moves me every time.
MusicBO;4;3630;A thing of this kind can never be got rid of entirely.
MusicBO;4;3668;With such experiences the boy will become quickly, almost too quickly, mature.

MusicBO;4;3955;About the middle of November we shall perform here a comic opera,

MusicBO;4;4378;What else is there that could very strongly and decisively attract me?
MusicBO;4;4474;, there is no chance of helping myself in any other way.
MusicBO;4;4561;You need, therefore, be in no particular hurry to finish the work.
MusicBO;4;4610;As to my fate I can tell you nothing, not knowing myself
MusicBO;4;4645;Perhaps I shall be able to assist you in simplifying the matter.
MusicBO;4;4652;What a beautiful day it will be when I see you here.
MusicBO;4;4739;Heaven only knows whether I have done it in the proper way.
MusicBO;4;4762;This, as you know, cannot be found in the rest of Germany.
MusicBO;4;4788;The old lady quite touches me by her love and sympathetic insight.
MusicBO;4;4802;May you rejoice in the joy which it has given to me.
MusicBO;4;4861;I should like to let my wife start as soon as possible.
MusicBO;4;4877;After that I hope to get you a few hundred francs more.
MusicBO;4;4881;Let it therefore take its course until we can do something better.
MusicBO;4;4890;Beautiful and noble traits of that kind are, unfortunately, seldom met with.
MusicBO;4;4932;and I feel convinced that, later on, you will agree with me.
MusicBO;4;4981;This is the first triumph of my art which I personally witness.
MusicBO;4;5038;You know what I require, and offer it to me in abundance.
MusicBO;4;5104;"DEAREST RICHARD, I have managed to get a copy of your ""Nibelungen."
MusicBO;4;5172;But the whole plan was always wrecked on the score of expenses.
MusicBO;5;3;"Composers cannot afford to be indifferent to the manner in which their works are presented to the public; and the public, naturally, cannot be expected to decide whether the performance of a piece of music is correct or faulty, since there are no data beyond the actual effect of the performance to judge by."
MusicBO;5;275;This movement (assuredly one of the most instructive in the present respect), finally (in the section in twelve-eight time), offers a conspicuous example of the breaking up of the pure Adagio by the more marked rhythms of an independent accompaniment, during which the cantilena is steadily and broadly continued.
MusicBO;5;114;However, to give an idea of it, I will select a passage by the aid of which I shall endeavour to shew the reason why Beethoven is so difficult to render, as well as the reason for the indifferent success of German orchestras when confronted by such difficulties.
MusicBO;5;121;With the fourth bar of the above passage we invariably got into a crescendo so that the sustained G flat of the fifth bar was given with an involuntary yet vehement accent, enough to spoil the peculiar tonal significance of that note.
MusicBO;5;96;"Later in life I discovered the reasons for this, and I have discussed them in my report on a ""German music school to be established at Munich,"" to which I beg to refer readers who may be interested in the subject."
MusicBO;5;805;What, then, can be the reason of this barrenness, dryness, coldness, this complete inability to feel the influence of true music, and, in its presence, to forget any little vexation, any small jealous distress, or any mistaken personal notion?
MusicBO;5;226;"For the orchestra, accustomed to play the piece in a quick tempo, would have been disturbed by the sudden imposition of a more moderate pace; which, as a matter of course, demands a totally different style of playing."
MusicBO;5;727;Among Germans, now living, I am, perhaps, the only person who can venture openly to pronounce so general a condemnation, and I maintain that I am not exceeding the limits of my province when I do so.
MusicBO;5;59;"many details of refined phrasing and expression feel more at home in the modern orchestra; which is indebted to their masterMendelssohn—for a particularly delicate and refined development in the direction opened up by Weber's original genius."
MusicBO;5;706;Even the shallowest theatrical concoctions, at the smallest Parisian theatres, can produce a pleasant aesthetical effect, since, as a rule, Even the shallowest theatrical concoctions, at the smallest Parisian theatres are carefully rehearsed, and correctly rendered.
MusicBO;5;284;This is particularly the case in those final movements which have grown out of the Rondeau, and of which the Finales to Mozart's Symphony in E flat, and to Beethoven's in A, are excellent examples.
MusicBO;5;374;In the foregoing investigations I hoped to have elucidated the problem of the modification of tempo, and to have shewn how a discerning mind will recognise and solve the difficulties inherent in modern classical music.
MusicBO;5;331;I was anxious to expose the dilemma, and to make everyone see and feel that since Beethoven there has been a very considerable change in the treatment and the execution of instrumental music.
MusicBO;5;535;"The opposition of the more subordinate musicians signifies nothing beyond this: ""we cannot advance, we do not want others to advance, and we are annoyed to see them advance in spite of us."
MusicBO;5;317;Let us merely consider it established that the character of the older classical or, as I call it, naive Allegro differs greatly from the new emotional sentimental Allegro, peculiar to Beethoven.
MusicBO;5;611;"Now, I knew what to expect from Liszt at the piano; but I had not expected anything like what I came to hear from Bach, though I had studied him well"
MusicBO;5;227;We have now reached an important and decisive point, an appreciation of which is indispensable if we care to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion regarding the execution of classical music.
MusicBO;5;273;I am, perhaps, the only conductor who has ventured to take the Adagio section of the third movement of the Ninth Symphony at the pace proper to its peculiar character.
MusicBO;5;662;But my experience has led me to understand that the essence of hypocrisy, and the singular tendency of a repulsive sect of hypocrites (Mucker), may be known by certain characteristics:—
MusicBO;5;731;I believe it to be my particular and personal misfortune that the two spirits meet in my operas, and mutually encourage one another in a rather dubious kind of way.
MusicBO;5;728;If I try to sum up my experiences, regarding performances of my own operas, I am at a loss to distinguish with which of the qualities of our conductors
MusicBO;5;734;"To convey some notion of faulty performances of the latter sort it will suffice to point to the way in which the overture to ""Die Meistersinger"" is usually given."
MusicBO;5;268;The sustained tone regulates the Tempo Adagio: here the rhythm is as the rhythm were dissolved in pure tone, the tone per se suffices for the musical expression.
MusicBO;5;672;"Herr Eduard Devrient, in his ""Erinnerungen,"" has given us an account of the difficulties his friend Mendelssohn met with in the search for a textbook to an opera."
MusicBO;5;483;"quite convinced that everything was in the best possible order, and that they were having a true Mozartian ""feast for the ears"" in all innocence and safety.—"
MusicBO;5;566;And German musicians now-a-days have good reason to be indignant if this miserable sham culture presumes to judge of the spirit and significance of our glorious music.
MusicBO;5;174;I remembered the reasons which may have led to its adoption well, when I came to lead the orchestra of the Philharmonic Society in London, 1855.
MusicBO;5;4;I shall endeavour to throw some light upon the characteristics of musical performances in Germany—with regard to the concertroom, as well as to the theatre.
MusicBO;5;34;The managers of these theatres are therefore in a position to select the men who are to represent the spirit and dignity of German music.
MusicBO;5;222;Still I could, at least, flatter myself that I had found somebody to share my views as to the difference between one tempo and another.
MusicBO;5;509;In many instances the objection in question is merely put forward as a pretext for opposition to all efforts in the direction I have indicated.
MusicBO;5;118;[The masterly execution of this passage by the Paris orchestra consisted in the fact that they played it EXACTLY as it is written.
MusicBO;5;194;This is one of the instances I have chosen out of many to throw light upon certain dubious aspects of music amongst us.
MusicBO;5;280;On careful examination of the principal motives of the Allegro it will be found that the melody (Gesang) derived from the Adagio, predominates.
MusicBO;5;473;It seems as though Mozart had expected something of the kind, for Mozart has given but few and meagre indications of the expression.
MusicBO;5;599;The first result of the new doctrine, and the most important for our investigations, came to light in the execution of classical music.
MusicBO;5;624;this subject might prove interesting to observe the attitude these reticent gentlemen take up with regard to performances such as Liszt's and Bulow's.
MusicBO;5;2;I do not mean to set up a system, but simply to state certain facts, and record a number of practical observations.
MusicBO;5;95;I was puzzled by the apparent flabbiness of Mozartian Melody (Cantilena) which I had been taught to regard as so delicately expressive.
MusicBO;5;105;I received a good lesson at Paris in 1839, when I heard the orchestra of the Conservatoire rehearse the enigmatical Ninth Symphony.
MusicBO;5;338;I shall now attempt to describe what I conceive to be the right way of performing Beethoven, and music akin to his.
MusicBO;5;145;Sebastian Bach, as a rule, does not indicate tempo at all, which in a truly musical sense is perhaps best.
MusicBO;5;329;We have now reached the point in our discussion from which we can judge the music of the day.
MusicBO;5;353;"Everybody agreed with me ""on the whole""; but in particular, people failed to see what I was aiming at."
MusicBO;5;410;Technically, the composer has managed to merge the character of this theme into the general character of the piece.
MusicBO;5;230;To illustrate this, in the simplest possible way, let us take the opening of the C minor Symphony
MusicBO;5;242;Suppose a conductor were to attempt to hold the fermata as here directed, what would be the result?
MusicBO;5;608;Bach very kindly complied, and I must confess that I have rarely been so much taken by surprise.
MusicBO;5;748;This overture was first performed at a concert at Leipzig, when I conducted the overture as described above.
MusicBO;5;800;they certainly ARE musicians and very competent musicians, who know and can do everything that pertains to music.
MusicBO;5;175;Mendelssohn had conducted the concerts during several seasons, and the tradition of his readings was carefully preserved.
MusicBO;5;248;And this is one of the first symptoms of the weakness of most of our orchestral performances.
MusicBO;5;448;I believe, there would be no harm in taking a good many other things, a la Wagner!
MusicBO;5;20;a practice, the evil effects of which are particularly noticeable with regard to the wind instruments.
MusicBO;5;277;We have seen that sustained tone with its modifications is the basis of all musical execution.
MusicBO;5;578;There is a QUASI physiological reason for this which I accidentally discovered once upon a time.
MusicBO;5;164;I have, myself, only once been present at a rehearsal of one of Beethoven's Symphonies,
MusicBO;5;315;But our conductors, in their customary crude way, generally miss this point in the overture.
MusicBO;5;695;For the present I shall only say a little about their ways as operatic conductors.
MusicBO;5;789;No one but Herr Hiller, Herr Rietz, or Herr Lachner is thought fit for this.
MusicBO;5;26;At the various court theatres, Italian operas have always found favour with the Directors.
MusicBO;5;333;It is essential that the style of execution shall agree with the matter set
MusicBO;5;595;In truth, it looks as though those reticent persons expected us to do so.
MusicBO;5;147;Let me be permitted to mention a few facts which concern me personally.
MusicBO;5;558;But there can be no harm in discussing our varnished and elegant friends.
MusicBO;5;717;Is the Herr Capellmeister not, in his turn, in a position to pray,
MusicBO;5;189;and as I now sang it to him, it would certainly please.
MusicBO;5;247;Without such basis an orchestra will produce much noise but no power.
MusicBO;5;399;The recollection of this flattering testimony has frequently cheered and encouraged me.
MusicBO;5;415;Allegro, I made use of the long drawn notes of the clarinet—
MusicBO;5;462;this passage proved at once strikingly effective—concise, laconic—as Beethoven meant this passage.
MusicBO;5;543;Our true German musician was originally a man difficult to associate with.
MusicBO;6;747;On his arrival at Naples Rossini signed a contract with Barbaja for several years, by which Barbaja agreed to write two new operas annually, and to arrange the music of all old works the manager might wish to produce, either at the San Carlo or at the Teatro del Fondo.
MusicBO;6;1880;"Altogether from the beginning of 1821 to the end of 1827, Mr. Ebers dropped money regularly every year; the smallest deficit in the budget of any one season being that of the last, when the manager thought himself fortunate to escape with a loss of not quite three thousand pounds."
MusicBO;6;124;Of the two operettas written for the San Mosè of Venice in the year 1812 nothing need be said, except that the music of the second, “L’occasione fa il ladro,” was presented at Paris, in a new shape, and under rather remarkable circumstances, only ten years ago.
MusicBO;6;957;It is also agreed that in case of the piece being forbidden, or the theatre closed by the act of the authority, or for any unforeseen reason, the habitual practice, in such cases, at the theatres of Rome and of all other countries, shall be observed.
MusicBO;6;1383;One young man in the pit—a student of music, and a pupil of Rolla, the leader of the orchestra—went almost into convulsions on hearing the drums, and wished to take summary vengeance on the composer who had ventured to introduce such instruments into an operatic orchestra.
MusicBO;6;1594;"IT was the fate of Rossini to have to write a certain number of complimentary cantatas, two of which were composed and executed in the year 1819; one in honour of the King of Naples, the other to congratulate his visitor the Emperor of Austria."
MusicBO;6;2022;For instance, in Mr. Ebers’s time, the manager of the Italian Opera of Paris was in a better position than the manager of the Italian Opera in London by fifteen thousand pounds a season, or three thousand seven hundred and fifty pounds a month.
MusicBO;6;181;In short, it was an anticipation of Offenbach, and it is astonishing that this musical burlesque of Rossini’s has never been reproduced substantially, or by imitation (it is scarcely probable that the original score was preserved), at the Bouffes Parisiens.
MusicBO;6;746;In the year 1814 Barbaja went to Bologna, called upon Rossini, and, with the liberality of an intelligent speculator dealing with an evidently rising artist, offered him a very much better engagement than had ever been within his reach before.
MusicBO;6;1574;"The opera was immensely applauded; but after the first two or three pieces the audience all remarked a Neapolitan merchant in the pit who seemed to know the work by heart, and anticipated the vocalists in singing the principal melodies."
MusicBO;6;2205;But it was not until the public had learned its true superiority from the very manœuvre which Paer had adopted in order to demonstrate its worthlessness that Rossini’s music was accepted by the Parisians at anything like its value.
MusicBO;6;102;In addition to the two works just mentioned, Rossini wrote “La Pietra del Paragone,” for Milan, and two one act operettas, “La Scala di Seta” and “L’occasione fa il ladro,” for Venice, in this fertile year of 1812.
MusicBO;6;1386;Then in a humble tone the young man set forth his reasons for introducing the instruments which had so irritated the student’s susceptible ears, and ended by promising never to offend in a similar manner again.
MusicBO;6;1657;I will quote one more passage from the “Musical Dictionary” to show what the operatic ideal was in 1730, and how much This reform differed from that of 1830, as entertained by Rossini, Auber, and Meyerbeer:—
MusicBO;6;198;"The orchestra was in a very subordinate position; the harmony was meagre, the instrumentation mild—many instruments, that were afterwards employed prominently and with great effect by Rossini, being kept in the background or entirely ignored."
MusicBO;6;1755;Matilda di Sabran” was produced at Rome for the Carnival of 1821, not at the scene of Rossini’s former triumph in the same capital, but at the “Apollo,” a theatre directed by the banker Torlonia.
MusicBO;6;2083;The composer on appearing in the theatre was received with great demonstrations of enthusiasm, and at the end of the first act was called on to the stage—at that time a novel and distinguished compliment.
MusicBO;6;2153;As for Paer, the director of the Italian theatre, his position did not allow him to express any opinion publicly on the works of the rival by whose fame his own had already been eclipsed.
MusicBO;6;2691;Nor would Heine himself have been pleased to see the criticism in which Heine expresses so poetically, and in such an admirable form, the true character of the “Stabat” music, represented by a mere fragment.
MusicBO;6;280;"The opera, then, was at first nothing but recitative, or recitative and chorus; the chorus having no dramatic character, but confining itself, in imitation of the most ancient models, to solemn criticism and comment."
MusicBO;6;802;The effect of the duet was to confirm the audience in the good opinion they had already formed of the composer, who, so far as Naples was concerned, was now only making his début.
MusicBO;6;1420;The same year, a few months after the production of “La Gazza Ladra,” Rossini brought out at the San Carlo an opera called “Armida,” in which the principal characters were assigned to Mdlle.
MusicBO;6;1849;an opera was conceived on too grand a scale, and Stendhal, apparently by reason of the importance assigned to the orchestra, came to the conclusion that it was written in the German style.
MusicBO;6;272;The only opera of Paisiello’s which has been presented in recent times, is his original musical setting of the “Barber of Seville,” written in 1780 for the Court Theatre at St. Petersburgh.
MusicBO;6;844;It was received at Paris, in 1825, for the début of Mademoiselle Marietta Garcia, the future Malibran, and the composer borrowed from it the motive of the magnificent letter duet in “Otello.
MusicBO;6;2247;"Rossini is said to have secretlyendeavoured to keep up the national cry against the composer; but the verses about “Signor Vacarmini” and “Signor Crescendo” were written while Rossini was still in Italy."
MusicBO;6;2176;"Of course, too, there were limits to the absurdity; and it must have been near its end when Armand Carrel went out on the boulevard to applaud the overture to “"
MusicBO;6;2328;"But wherever we have seen Rossini at work Rossini has always adopted a compromise; Rossini subjects circumstances to himself, but Rossini is also obliged to subject himself a little to circumstances."
MusicBO;6;2489;It exhibits more sustained power, and is the only one of his operas for the French stage in which every piece of music is new and written specially for the situation.
MusicBO;6;906;the stage is composed on a firm scaffolding, unlike that of “Guillaume Tell,” which very soon broke down, and has never been put together again in a durable dramatic form.
MusicBO;6;938;The same day, December 26th, 1815, Rossini signed an agreement with the manager, Cesarini, by which Rossini bound himself to furnish the second work on the 20th of January following.
MusicBO;6;2505;and, moreover, the grandest of all dramatic scenes in regard to the treatment of masses, which in the spoken drama can only be employed as a means of spectacular effect.
MusicBO;6;1779;However this may have been, Rossini knew and greatly admired Beethoven’s work, and Rossini made a point of calling upon the great composer soon after his arrival in Vienna.
MusicBO;6;2664;Much nonsense has been written about this very beautiful work, which, on its first production, was severely though clumsily handled in several quarters, from a parochial point of view.
MusicBO;6;594;The Berlin opera would insist on having an air or a duet placed in such a scene, written in such a style, with such and such an accompaniment.
MusicBO;6;1844;These innovations are once more specified to remind the reader of the progress Rossini had made as a dramatic composer since his first Venetian opera of “Tancredi.
MusicBO;6;2103;A great deal has been said about the intrigues against Rossini, and the attacks made upon his music in the newspapers on his first arrival in Paris.
MusicBO;6;105;The libretto of “La Pietra” is based on an idea not absolutely new, and which, for that very reason perhaps, is generally successful on the stage.
MusicBO;6;879;That is the subject of the “Barber of Seville,” capable of being made with equal success into a tragedy, a comedy, a drama, an opera, &c.
MusicBO;6;1300;It seemed to him, no doubt, that the device had now been sufficiently employed—which, however, did not force his successors to be of the same opinion.
MusicBO;6;1352;It is a domestic drama set to music—very inferior, as to the subject, to its successors in the same style, “La Sonnambula,” and “Linda di Chamouni.
MusicBO;6;2273;"only one act lasted three hours; only one act contained fifteen or sixteen pieces, including a ballet; and only one act was divided into three parts."
MusicBO;6;2377;In fact, at this moment we have no operatic system, the custom still prevalent in other countries of producing original operas having in England died out.
MusicBO;6;2394;It was, of course, found necessary to reconstruct the drama, which in England became “Zora,” as the Italian “Mosè,” five-and-twenty years before, had become “Pietro l’Eremita.”
MusicBO;6;85;La Cambiale di Matrimonio” was followed by the cantata of “Didone Abbandonata,” which Rossini composed for a relation, the afterwards celebrated Esther Mombelli, in 1811.
MusicBO;6;397;The fact is, Rossini rendered both styles more natural, more like life, as far as life can be represented in opera, and certainly more dramatic.
MusicBO;6;538;In exhibiting their talent first in the simple, and afterwards in the highly decorative style, they appear in each case to have gone to extremes.
MusicBO;6;646;Stendhal speaks of a town of ten thousand inhabitants where the grass grew in the street, which contrived to maintain its opera in good condition.
MusicBO;6;1180;The clarinet was not invented until the end of the seventeenth century, and was not recognised until long afterwards, even in Germany, as an orchestralinstrument.
MusicBO;6;1903;It is observable, too, that though he does not like the new composer himself, he never attempts to deny Rossini’s great success with the public.
MusicBO;6;2516;It would be useless to speak of it to those who have heard it—impossible to give any idea of it to those who have not.
MusicBO;6;73;” was the subject of this, Rossini’s first work, written when Rossini was sixteen years of age, and executed at Bologna in August, 1808.

MusicBO;6;605;ROSSINI would have been amused if any one had written a book about him and his music entitled “Rossini and his Three Styles.”
MusicBO;6;713;Rossini seldom began to write until a few weeks, sometimes a very few weeks indeed, before the day fixed for the first representation.
MusicBO;6;870;It would be rendering no service to Rossini to compare him with Mozart, whom Rossini himself regarded as the greatest of dramatic composers.
MusicBO;6;871;"But Rossini’s genius is very much akin to that of Beaumarchais; whereas that of Mozart (to the disadvantage certainly of Beaumarchais) was not."

MusicBO;6;1871;The King’s Theatre was then in the hands of Mr. Ebers, who has left an interesting and instructive account of his operatic experience.
MusicBO;6;1885;Some, too, may have complained of the constant preference given to his operas above those of all other composers, from mere professional jealousy.
MusicBO;6;2460;After the first few weeks, in spite of the well-merited eulogiums of the critical press, the opera ceased, in theatrical parlance, to draw.
MusicBO;6;2680;As among the painters, so among the musicians, there is an entirely false idea as to the proper manner of treating religious subjects.
MusicBO;6;81;This, the first work addressed by Rossini to the general public, was a trifle in one act, called “La Cambiale di Matrimonio.
MusicBO;6;127;Un Curioso Accidente” was the title given to this pasticcio in two acts, which was announced as a new Opera by Rossini.
MusicBO;6;591;The Berlin opera would have been a good school for the sopranists, “who,” says M. Castil-Blaze, “were at all times extremely insolent.

MusicBO;6;2650;It amused him, Don Varela said, to hear the pupils, who formed a complete orchestra, play all possible kinds of orchestral works.
MusicBO;6;15;It is clear, then, that in Rossini the Italian music of the nineteenth century is represented, and, as it were, comprised.
MusicBO;6;146;The effect of this letter was to cause the entire disappearance of “Un Curioso Accidente,” which was not heard of again.
MusicBO;6;1390;The audience rose, applauded, called out to the composer, after the queer Italian fashion, and continued to applaud for several minutes.
MusicBO;6;1714;Rossini would not acknowledge the work as belonging to him, but did not object to its being presented to the public,
MusicBO;6;2133;Indeed, Boieldieu, Hérold, Auber, were all fervent admirers of Rossini, and all to a certain extent adopted him as a model.
MusicBO;6;2455;In fact, the preface clearly shows, that in its original form this preface must have been altogether useless for musical purposes.
MusicBO;6;384;The most brilliant Amenaide ever heard was probably Madame Sontag, who appeared in that character in 1829 to Malibran’s Tancredi.

MusicBO;6;2129;"Rossini has no need of that to raise himself; his great talent will always put him in his proper place."
MusicBO;6;2282;It was a droll idea, but it seems to have been adopted and carried out without the slightest satirical intention.
MusicBO;6;2290;In fact, the composer raised the Théâtre Italien of Paris to the position of the first Italian Opera in Europe.

MusicBO;6;2472;"That alone did not cause him to lay down his pen; but it did not prevent his doing so."

MusicBO;6;13;William Tell composed a cantata when William Tell was sixteen, and a mass when William Tell was seventy-two.
MusicBO;6;55;It has been said that Rossini was of obscure origin, but this only applies to his immediate progenitors.
MusicBO;6;1078;At the beginning of the magnificent finale a cat appeared on the stage, and with the usual effect.
MusicBO;6;1348;Thus, Paer’s “Leonora, ossia l’amore conjugale” came to be overshadowed by the superior presence of Beethoven’s great work.
MusicBO;6;1357;The plot is so badly woven in “La Gazza Ladra” that The plot scarcely hangs together at all.
MusicBO;6;1718;As it was, Rossini contented himself with ridiculing it in a letter which was circulated at the time.
MusicBO;6;1948;“Se fiato” from “Il Matrimonio Segretto,” and both in the solo and in the duet was enthusiastically applauded.
MusicBO;6;2149;"I said to myself; ‘besides, what is the use of composing music, if one cannot compose like Rossini?"
MusicBO;6;2157;Méry, in the preface to his French version of “Semiramide,” has given a lively description of the scene.
MusicBO;6;192;when, moreover, no one thought of comparing Rossini’s works with any but works by other Italian composers.
MusicBO;6;1412;Once more let it be remarked that almost everything new in Rossini was already old in Mozart.
MusicBO;6;1565;The experiment does not seem to have been successful as far as the public taste was concerned.
MusicBO;6;1747;The other singers were Mademoiselle Colbran, Mademoiselle Chaumel (the future wife of Rubini), Nozzare, Cicimarra, and Benedetti.
MusicBO;6;2488;It is written throughout in a higher and more dramatic style than any of his previous works.
MusicBO;6;573;The theatres are full of artists who have picked up music from singing-masters about the country.
MusicBO;6;639;Rossini had written two operas, besides a cantata, “Egle e Irene,” composed for the princess Belgiojoso.
MusicBO;6;702;The place for determined listeners who wished to hear everything, was supposed to be the pit.

MusicBO;6;2577;I do not require much to be excited into composition, as my opera texts prove, but
MusicBO;6;110;As for the young lady the young lady comes out in the most brilliant colours.
MusicBO;6;690;This has already been mentioned, but it is worth remembering in connection with Rossini’s operas.
MusicBO;6;723;But as regards the opera, Germany inherited from Scarlatti almost as much as Italy herself.
MusicBO;6;998;Rossini not only kept up with the librettist, but sometimes found himself getting in advance.
MusicBO;6;1007;Probably too the spirited impresario called occasionally to inquire how the work generally was progressing.
MusicBO;6;1085;The hubbub was so great, that nothing like it was ever heard at any theatre.
MusicBO;6;1190;Mozart’s trombones in “Don Giovanni” were considered a novelty at the Italian Opera of Vienna.
MusicBO;6;1237;This was his constant practice, and its justification is to be found in its success.
MusicBO;6;1382;It cannot be said, however, that Rossini’s overture was applauded without a single dissentient voice.
MusicBO;6;1402;Now it is the first thing that occurs to them when they are in trouble.
MusicBO;6;1997;In this manner things went off without any disastrous results, and every one was pleased.
MusicBO;6;2031;vos salutat is the fitting motto of the British impresario on entering the managerial arena.
MusicBO;6;2073;Before coming to London Rossini had been uncertain whether to return to Paris or not.
MusicBO;6;2233;Otherwise, without delaying Rossini’s triumph, Rossini certainly would have increased the number of Rossini’s enemies.
MusicBO;6;2558;"You have a passion for industry; I always had a passion for idleness,” exclaimed Rossini."
MusicBO;6;27;Some of his most beautiful thoughts came to him suddenly as if by inspiration.
MusicBO;6;1181;The clarinet was introduced into French orchestras towards the end of the eighteenth century.
MusicBO;6;1354;The heroine of each of these dramas is the victim of a slight mistake.
MusicBO;6;1419;Barbaja fulfilled his promise, and in January, 1817, the new San Carlo was reopened.
MusicBO;6;1516;A story like this is worth verifying, or at least tracing to its source.
MusicBO;6;2052;The general result, then, of Rossini’s visit to London may be thus summed up.
MusicBO;6;2342;The first of this series was “Le Siège de Corinthe,” based on “Maometto Secondo.
MusicBO;6;2458;But an opera cannot live by its music alone, and the drama of “
MusicBO;6;2629;I remained with my wife, whom M. Rossini’s person and conversation had much interested.
MusicBO;6;83;It was produced in 1810, and Rossini received about eight pounds for it.
MusicBO;6;96;The result was “Ciro in Babilonia,” produced at the beginning of Lent, 1812.
MusicBO;6;350;No operatic overture was at one time more popular than that of “Tancredi.
MusicBO;6;424;Nothing easier,” an ordinary composer would say, “than to pick it up again.
MusicBO;6;710;Rossini, until Rossini established his head-quarters at Naples, was constantly travelling about Italy.
MusicBO;6;768;One can guess what Rossini’s own politics must have been, from his temperament.
MusicBO;6;782;The townspeople knew that The townspeople were about to hear their patriotic hymn.
MusicBO;6;1082;Then Rossini turned towards the public, shrugged his shoulders, and began to applaud.
MusicBO;6;1315;But of late years this opera has seldom been played, and in England
MusicBO;6;1684;—this certainly would have been too much for the Italian audiences of 1813.
MusicBO;6;2396;It was admirably represented, like the rest of the later works by Rossini,
MusicBO;6;2500;Guillaume Tell,” Rossini had previously given an example in “La Donna del Lago.
MusicBO;6;580;I will not leave them a place for adding the least appoggiatura.
MusicBO;6;638;In the meanwhile, even in 1814, Rossini had done his year’s work.
MusicBO;6;1095;This was all that was needed to insure the opera’s triumphant success.
MusicBO;6;1132;Iago, in the operatic version of “Othello,” is only a secondary character.
MusicBO;6;1163;However, “Otello” is one of Rossini’s finest works in the serious style.
MusicBO;6;1513;You shall have the third act in a quarter of an hour.
MusicBO;6;1828;In composing “Semiramide,” the work destined for Venice, Rossini took his time.
MusicBO;6;2020;The reason of these constant collapses may be explained by simple arithmetic.
MusicBO;6;2253;In this matter Rossini behaved with great consideration towards his jealous rival.
MusicBO;6;2340;Levasseur and Mademoiselle Cinti were accustomed to the Italian school of vocalisation.
MusicBO;6;2356;It was the first opera that Rossini sold to a music publisher.
MusicBO;6;2464;the public heard nothing of “Guillaume Tell” but the celebrated second act.
MusicBO;6;2504;It may, indeed, be cited as the grandest operatic scene that exists—
MusicBO;9;66;"looking toward the King, then Gurnemanz Spake with his own sad heart: ""the King Amfortas comes, my King,A helpless burden to his servitors."
MusicBO;9;590;"Yea, I remember all the days of yore,That once I sought the holier, happier life, Within the service of the Holy Grail;"
MusicBO;9;1163;Again they climbed the rocky passages, And reached at last the castle's pillared hall, Crowned with the mighty dome of blazing light.
MusicBO;9;258;And clutching at his breast as if in pain the young boy stricken with remorse stood a time in conscious agony,
MusicBO;9;803;For this is fire and flame within my heart That sways my senses in delirium,The awful madness of tormenting love!
MusicBO;9;481;And all did kneel, And raised their eyes in joyous reverence Toward that bright glory in the darkened room.
MusicBO;9;7;And at its foot a smiling, shimmering lake Lay in the still lap of a verdant glade. '
MusicBO;9;807;The rapture of redemption sweet and mild Trembleth afar through all the universe, Except within a sin-polluted heart.
MusicBO;9;987;For days of saddest peace have come to us, And deeds of valiant arms no more are done.
MusicBO;9;141;But now, whate'er the past, she is with us, And serves us to atone for earlier guilt.

MusicBO;9;871;For I am also sent to save thy soul And to deliver thee from curse of lust.
MusicBO;9;455;And as he ended in an anguished sob, The boys' sweet voices chanted from the dome:
MusicBO;9;630;Wounded in arm and limb, they yield, they fly, And carry off a multitude of scars.
MusicBO;9;844;She stopped in pain and for an awful moment Her deed spake in the silence, horror-stricken.
MusicBO;9;952;, That lead to rocky cliffs among whose peaks Lies Monsalvat, the castle of the Grail.
MusicBO;9;977;In deep amaze she wakened from her sleep, And opened her sad eyes, with startled cries.
MusicBO;9;16;Come, let us thank God That we have power to hear the call of life,
MusicBO;9;240;Such sacrilege within these holy woods, Where seems to dwell the perfect peace of God.
MusicBO;9;354;Meanwhile the litter of the King came back With all its retinue of gallant knights.
MusicBO;9;383;At length they reached the noble pillared hall Within the castle of the Holy Grail,
MusicBO;9;430;For serving faithfully thou mayst atone For all the grievous sin of thy sad life.
MusicBO;9;663;Thus do I win my way to you,The loveliest maidens that mine eyes have seen.
MusicBO;9;1232;And quick the sacred shrine was opened wide And Parsifal long knelt in silent prayer,
MusicBO;9;50;The mare is staggering with weariness,No wonder, for its flight was through the air,
MusicBO;9;276;And in a strange and dazed way the young boy stricken with remorse replied:
MusicBO;9;445;It leaps in bounds of pain, Like torments of the lowest depths of hell,
MusicBO;9;811;Yet I, forgetting what my Lord had said, Have wandered off in boyish foolishness….
MusicBO;9;1164;Slowly the knights in mourning garb marched in, Bearing the corpse of saintly Titurel.
MusicBO;9;343;It means calamity To those whom I in vain have tried to serve.
MusicBO;9;442;The sacred stream that flows Within the crystal, gloriously shines With radiance heaven-born.
MusicBO;9;814;, blest Redeemer mine, And show me how my sin can be atoned!
MusicBO;9;260;And then the young boy stricken with remorse turned again to Gurnemanz
MusicBO;9;651;And Parsifal, astounded at the scene, Stood silently upon the castle walls,
MusicBO;9;1073;The holy Supper also is denied us,Our daily portion only common food.
MusicBO;9;1222;God gave it me but to restore to his own sacred Spear!

MusicBO;35;17;"The dialogue appeared under the name of one of the interlocutors, Alemanno Benelli; this is an anagram of Annibale Melone, a prominent Bolognese musician and teacher whom Bottrigari chose to honour."
MusicBO;35;39;Artusi noted that there are more dissonances in counterpoint than consonances and that they are particularly useful for setting words expressing sorrow, tears and pain.
MusicBO;35;49;This stimulated Monteverdi's famous reply in Il quinto libro de' madrigali (1605) and a gloss on this letter by his brother Giulio Cesare in Scherzi
MusicBO;35;21;Actually, although Artusi covered some of the same ground as Bottrigari and was probably stimulated by Il Trimerone, there is no evidence of plagiarism.

MusicBO;35;15;The controversy that developed between Artusi and Bottrigari is not unrelated to that between Zarlino and Galilei.
MusicBO;35;28;To this Artusi replied in Considerationi musicali, printed in Seconda parte dell'Artusi (1603), mockingly dedicated to Bottrigari.
MusicBO;35;37;It is the first published book devoted entirely to the use of dissonances.
MusicBO;36;2;Born into a family of organists, he studied with his father, Pietro Bossi (1834–96), then at the Liceo Musicale, Bologna (1871–3), and at the Milan Conservatory (1873–81), where his teachers included Ponchielli.
MusicBO;36;3;In 1881 he was appointed organist at Como Cathedral, and in due course he won worldwide renown as one of the finest organists of the day.
MusicBO;37;62;He wrote several books on the dialects found in the vicinity of Bologna and edited and reprinted a book by Giovanni Zanti on the architecture of Bologna.

MusicBO;38;8;In 1546 Bottrigari, supported by his father, established a private press in the centre of Bologna, probably modelled on the ‘Tipografia bocchiana’ loosely connected to the Accademia Hermatena.
MusicBO;38;15;There he established himself as a private scholar, surrounded by his books and manuscripts and in contact with like-minded scholars (including Zarlino) in other parts of Italy.

MusicBO;38;31;‘Il canter novo’ (which appears in Il Melone) experiments with chromatic writing.
MusicBO;39;76;His great contribution to the development of music in Bologna lay in his initiative in attracting fine instrumentalists to S Petronio, in inventing and encouraging the composition of a new genre of instrumental music and providing a place for it in the liturgy.
MusicBO;39;36;The written polemic seems to have ended here, except that Cazzati reprinted the offending op.17 in 1667 with some errors corrected, but not those which concerned his alleged mistakes in using the first mode.
MusicBO;39;3;During his term as maestro di cappella of S Petronio, Bologna (1657–71), he made significant contributions to the development of instrumental music, especially in the unique repertory of music for trumpet and strings.
MusicBO;39;9;He was in charge of music at the court of Scipione Gonzaga, Prince of Bozzolo in 1647 and 1648, when he was elected maestro di cappella of the Accademia della Morte at Ferrara.
MusicBO;39;14;In April 1657 he returned to Ferrara, serving again as maestro di cappella of the Accademia della Morte until late August, when he applied for a similar post at S Petronio, Bologna.
MusicBO;39;50;Although instrumental music forms only a relatively small part of Cazzati’s output of 66 published volumes, it is in this genre that Cazzati made his most influential contribution.
MusicBO;39;23;The controversy centred round some musical errors in the Kyrie of Cazzati’s Missa primi toni published in the five-part Messa e salmi op.17 (1655).

MusicBO;39;11;On 17 April 1653 he was elected maestro di cappella of S Maria Maggiore, Bergamo.

MusicBO;42;20;In a preface Giacobbi gave instructions and suggestions regarding the disposition of the choirs, soloists and instrumentalists.
MusicBO;43;58;His view of medieval music is revealed in the preparatory work Martini did in manuscript (dated c1774–84) for the fourth of the projected five volumes, which is sufficiently complete to indicate that Martini did not go beyond the traditional 16th-century schematization based on the three figures of Pope Gregory, Guido of Arezzo and Johannes de Muris.
MusicBO;43;4;"He had his first music lessons from his father Antonio Maria, a violinist and cellist; subsequent teachers were Angelo Predieri, Giovanni Antonio Ricieri, Francesco Antonio Pistocchi (singing) and Giacomo Antonio Perti (composition)."
MusicBO;43;44;"Some items, including the important library of Ercole Bottrigari, came into Martini’s possession by bequest (1751); others were either purchased or exchanged for copies of his own greatly valued printed works."
MusicBO;43;11;In 1758, at the age of 52, Martini was made a member of the Accademia dell’Istituto delle Scienze di Bologna, after presenting the ‘Dissertatio de usu progressionis geometricae in musica’.
MusicBO;43;60;Although somewhat disappointing from a modern historiographical perspective, the Storia della musica contains valuable observations on the intimate nature of plainchant (canto fermo) as opposed to canto figurato.
MusicBO;43;69;Martini supported the idea of multiple styles inherited from the 17th century, comparing it to the potential levelling implied by modern theories (specifically that of Rameau).
MusicBO;43;56;Together with most of Martini’s library Together with most of Martini’s library served as the basis of the present Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale in Bologna.
MusicBO;43;21;Martini was offered positions in the Vatican, and possibly in Padua, but Martini chose to remain in the city of his birth.
MusicBO;43;37;His character, as revealed in the portrait by Angelo Crescimbeni, has been described as a mixture of affability and underlying arrogance (Morelli).
MusicBO;43;45;One of Martini’s most important legacies is his extensive correspondence (about 6000 letters), only a small part of which has been published.
MusicBO;43;62;Martini’s didactic approach is best represented in the two volumes of his Esemplare, o sia Saggio fondamentale pratico di contrappunto (1774–6).
MusicBO;43;27;Despite the lack of biographical detail, there are many descriptions of Martini’s extremely active creative life in different areas.
MusicBO;43;36;Martini maintained, however, good relationships with colleagues whose views Martini did not share (e.g. F.A. Vallotti and Tartini himself).
MusicBO;43;18;In 1776 Martini was elected a member of the Arcadian Academy in Rome, with the name Aristosseno Anfioneo.
MusicBO;43;33;Martini refrained as much as possible from polemics and personal conflicts, but Martini was firm in his opinions.
MusicBO;43;43;Personal contacts with the most famous musicians, scholars and rulers in Europe were valuable for the same purpose.
MusicBO;43;7;In 1725 he succeeded Padre Ferdinando Gridi as maestro di cappella of S Francesco.
MusicBO;43;9;Martini received minor orders in 1725, and four years later was ordained a priest.
MusicBO;43;19;Martini devoted himself assiduously to composing, writing and teaching, and Martini seldom left Bologna.
MusicBO;43;49;Martini assembled also a unique collection of portraits, including both contemporary and earlier musicians.
MusicBO;43;20;Martini visited Florence, Siena and Pisa in 1759, and Rome on several occasions.

MusicBO;43;195;Compendio della teoria de’ numeri per uso del musico (Bologna, 1769)
MusicBO;44;31;A natural consequence of Martucci's conducting activities was a growing urge to write major works for orchestral forces: the first important result was the Second Piano Concerto (the only one his son himself saw fit to publish) which had its première, with the composer as pianist, in Naples on 31 January 1886.
MusicBO;44;35;director of the Bologna Liceo Musicale was also put in charge of music for the cappella musicale at S Petronio and of Bologna's so-called Società del Quartetto, which (like its counterparts in other Italian cities) by then also ran orchestral concerts.
MusicBO;44;7;When the boy and his younger sister Teresa showed precocious promise as pianists, Gaetano brought them before the public in a series of local concerts, starting with one in Pozzuoli in December 1864.
MusicBO;44;33;Another crucial event in 1886 was his appointment, almost simultaneously, to three major posts in Bologna, following Luigi Mancinelli's sudden desertion of all of them to settle in England.
MusicBO;44;76;However, the most ambitious work that Martucci completed before moving to Bologna is the Second Piano Concerto, which is incomparably richer and more intense than the repudiated First.
MusicBO;44;29;Meanwhile his repertory, both as conductor and as pianist, also stretched backwards in time to include music by composers such as J.S. Bach, Rameau and Domenico Scarlatti.
MusicBO;44;14;Prudent and useful links had been established with the local aristocracy, who were to do much to further Martucci's career during the next few years.
MusicBO;44;93;The Second Symphony – the only large-scale piece that Martucci completed after his return to Naples in 1902 – is more truly personal.
MusicBO;44;38;Another notable pioneering venture was his introduction to Italy in 1895 of Schumann's Szenen aus Goethes Faust.
MusicBO;44;11;At the Reale Collegio his main teachers were Cesi for piano and Paolo Serrao for composition.
MusicBO;44;73;The early 1880s also saw the births of three of his very best chamber compositions.
MusicBO;44;36;Martucci's Bologna period was in many ways the culmination of his public career.
MusicBO;45;7;He was admitted to membership in the Ducal Accademia Filarmonica of Modena in 1780, and the Accademia Filarmonica of Bologna in 1799 which he served as principe in 1803, 1808 and 1818.
MusicBO;45;14;However, Mattei’s one published theoretical work, Pratica d’accompagnamento sopra bassi numerati (Bologna, c 1824–5), was translated into French and widely used during the 19th century.
MusicBO;45;10;In 1824 he was elected an associate member of the Académie des Beaux-Arts de l’Institut Royal de France.
MusicBO;45;9;For a brief period in 1809 he was maestro di cappella at S Antonio in Padua.
MusicBO;45;4;Like his teacher he entered the Franciscan order of Friars Minor Conventual.
MusicBO;46;16;For sacred and instrumental music, however, production was far more extensive, preferred authors being G.P. Colonna, Cossoni, Filippini, G.B. Vitali, Bononcini, G.B. Degli Antoni, G.B. Bassani, Mazzaferrata, Cazzati, Albergati, Corelli, Berardi and Penna.
MusicBO;46;17;Monti published an index, probably in 1682, of works printed by the firm (Indice dell’opere di musica sin’hora stampate da Giacomo Monti in Bologna).
MusicBO;47;4;The composers whose works were published by the Monti firm during these years (mostly between 1690 and 1695) included Giovanni Bononcini, Domenico Gabrielli, Corelli, G.P. Colonna, Elia Vannini, Jacchini, G.B. Bassani and Francesco Passarini.

MusicBO;48;50;His purpose as stated in the preface was ‘to demonstrate with the greatest brevity and clarity possible the manner of applying all the principles of music to the modern style’: this statement indicates his characteristic ability to adapt his well-founded musical skills to the changes of style that occurred during his long creative life.
MusicBO;48;6;At the age of nine Italian composer began to study music in Bologna with his uncle Lorenzo Perti and with Rocco Laurenti, from whom Italian composer learnt the rudiments of organ playing.
MusicBO;48;45;A large group of separate versetti intended as substitutes for sections of the masses show the adaptability of the masses to occasions of varying degrees of splendour.
MusicBO;48;33;Padre Martini held him in the highest esteem and included six examples of his contrapuntal music in his Esemplare ossia Saggio fondamentale pratico di contrappunto (1774–5).

MusicBO;50;579;Rossini's musical score is both serious and ironic at once, serious in the elaboration and complexity of the music, ironic in applying such extraordinary music to a series of operatic tableaux that gently mock the dramaturgical conventions of the genre.
MusicBO;50;659;Rossini had been so closely associated with the old regime that his influence there was gone, but the Liceo Rossini maintained ties with the Théâtre Italien, actively supporting the production of works by his younger contemporaries, particularly Donizetti and Bellini.
MusicBO;50;426;These include Armida (9 November 1817), Mosè in Egitto (5 March 1818), Ricciardo e Zoraide (3 December 1818), Ermione (27 March 1819), La donna del lago (24 October 1819), Maometto II (3 December 1820) and Zelmira (16 February 1822).
MusicBO;50;34;His abilities as a singer were well enough recognized that in June 1806 Gioachino followed his father into the Accademia Filarmonica of Bologna, honoured for his accomplishments as a singer, a singular recognition for so young a man.
MusicBO;50;312;The resulting opera was Almaviva, ossia L'inutile precauzione, a title adopted to distinguish an opera from Paisiello's well-known Il barbiere di Siviglia, although the more common title appeared when the work was revived in Bologna during summer 1816.
MusicBO;50;736;"The last years of Rossini's life must be understood against the background of his physical illness and mental exhaustion during the previous 20 years; for it is no exaggeration to say that, in Paris, Rossini returned to life."
MusicBO;50;722;a significant cantata in honour of the new pope, largely derived from pieces in his operas, Ricciardo e Zoraide, Armida, Ermione and Le siège de Corinthe was performed in Rome, at the Campidoglio, on 1 January 1847.
MusicBO;50;190;Often, especially in his cavatinas (entrance arias), Rossini composed two successive, separate lyrical sections, an opening cantabile and concluding cabaletta, thus giving the impression of dramatic change even when actual change is slight or non-existent.
MusicBO;50;837;But throughout, Italian opera depended upon the musical forms, the style of orchestration, the rhythmic vitality and the role of music in defining and shaping the drama first developed fully in the operas of Rossini.
MusicBO;50;13;During his early career his son performed in military bands and served the ceremonial function of public trombetta, the position his son obtained in Pesaro when his son took up residence there in 1790.
MusicBO;50;323;‘I cannot help thinking that Il barbiere di Siviglia, for the abundance of true musical ideas, for its comic verve and the accuracy of its declamation, is the most beautiful opera buffa there is’.
MusicBO;50;460;And Rossini was not first exposed to French opera in Paris: Guillaume Tell directed the revival of Spontini's Fernand Cortez at the Teatro S Carlo in 1820, shortly before Guillaume Tell composed Maometto II.
MusicBO;50;707;But it is important to recognize that the statement is really a disguised attack on its style, affirming by implication that the piece is neither specifically religious in quality nor deeply felt.
MusicBO;50;77;Rossini's operatic career began in earnest in 1810, with a commission from the Teatro S Moisè of Venice to compose the music for Gaetano Rossi's one-act farsa, La cambiale di matrimonio.
MusicBO;50;291;It is also one of the most disturbing, as Don Geronio is thrust deeper and deeper into a confusion of identity as the music and masqueraded characters swirl around him.
MusicBO;50;686;He and Olympe established a salon in Milan during winter 1837–8 and gave a number of musical soirées similar in style to the more famous Parisian ones of the 1860s.
MusicBO;50;703;Even at the final rehearsal, which Rossini attended, in the middle of the day, the Liceo Rossini was accompanied to his home to the shouting of more than 500 persons.
MusicBO;50;44;During his years at the Liceo Rossini wrote a few instrumental pieces, some sacred music (including a Mass commissioned in 1809 by the cathedral of Rimini) and a cantata,
MusicBO;50;219;Once positions have been stated, the characters often continue in dialogue, though in this example an orchestral modulation (typically to the mediant major) leads directly to the second section.
MusicBO;50;338;di Siviglia is an opera that can be appreciated on many levels, and what Il barbiere di Siviglia may lack in the humanity of Mozart's Le nozze di Figaro
MusicBO;50;701;Among the soloists were Clara Novello and Nikolay Ivanov, who became a close friend of Rossini and for whom, at Rossini's request, Verdi expressly composed some substitute arias.
MusicBO;50;765;the song itself is a straightforward romance, with the whole-tone scale appearing only briefly in a cadential context (using the harmonization worked out previously in the piano vignette).
MusicBO;50;380;But the powerful and shrewd impresario of the Neapolitan theatres, Domenico Barbaia, seeking to revitalize operatic life in Naples, invited Rossini both to compose for his theatres
MusicBO;50;723;A complete manuscript of the cantata recently came to light, and the work has proved to be more successful in modern revivals than one might have suspected.
MusicBO;50;747;Their historical position remains to be assessed, but it seems likely that their effect, direct or indirect, on composers like Camille Saint-Saëns and Erik Satie was significant.
MusicBO;50;767;The D major tonality of the main section is nicely balanced in the centre by Rossini's use of chromatic sequences, a frequent device in these late works.
MusicBO;50;679;With the pension affair settled in his favour, Rossini took a short trip to Germany with another banker, Lionel de Rothschild, meeting both Mendelssohn and Hiller.
MusicBO;50;238;The lines are clear, the melodies crystalline, the rhythms vital without being exaggerated, the harmonies simple but with enough chromatic inflections to keep the attention.
MusicBO;50;384;Indeed Rossini's Neapolitan period was important precisely because Giannetto wrote for a specific theatre, the Teatro S Carlo, with a fine orchestra and superb singers.
MusicBO;50;528;Indeed, Rossini's wealth grew from his association with Barbaia in a company running the profitable gambling tables in the foyer of the Teatro S Carlo.
MusicBO;50;657;the Liceo Rossini hoped quickly to regulate his financial affairs, but the courts did not decide the future of his annuity until six years later.
MusicBO;50;391;Elisabetta belongs to the world of Aureliano in Palmira and Sigismondo, not to the world of Mosè in Egitto or La donna del lago.
MusicBO;50;544;the Liceo Rossini had written 34 operas, the best of which formed a large proportion of the repertory in opera houses throughout the peninsula.
MusicBO;50;605;These two revisions prepared for Rossini's great French operas, the opéra comique Le comte Ory (20 August 1828) and Guillaume Tell (3 August 1829).
MusicBO;50;831;Rossini's historical position was distorted by the prominence of his great comic operas, which are among the last and finest representatives of buffo style.
MusicBO;50;821;This occurred in 1887, and at a solemn ceremony on 2 May 1887 Rossini found his final resting-place at S Croce in Florence.
MusicBO;50;78;According to a student of Giovanni Morandi, cited by Radiciotti, a German composer scheduled to write the opera reneged on his contract.
MusicBO;50;491;The ensemble begins as if The ensemble were to be a simple trio, with a static section followed by a kinetic one.
MusicBO;50;682;By the end of summer 1836 Rossini returned to Paris to tidy up his affairs, departing again on 24 October for Italy.
MusicBO;50;827;This image resulted from the abundance of biographical sources that reflected the period after a man withdrew from operatic composition in 1829.
MusicBO;50;107;One can understand, if not wholly respect, the insouciance with which Rossini simplified his task of grinding out so many operas.
MusicBO;50;143;Whereas Rossini grew in stature as a dramatist during his career, he was from the outset a consummate composer of overtures.
MusicBO;50;249;L'italiana in Algeri, to a libretto by Angelo Anelli first set by Luigi Mosca (1808), fully shared the success of Tancredi.
MusicBO;50;518;Indeed it is to Rossini's Neapolitan operas that a generation of composers, including Bellini and Donizetti, looked for inspiration and guidance.
MusicBO;50;768;Among the songs there are more traditional, sentimental, even maudlin compositions, such as L'orphéline du Tyrol, or the Chanson de Zora.
MusicBO;50;182;Formal procedures in particular, uncertain and tentative in earlier operas, assume the characteristics that were now to dominate Italian opera.
MusicBO;50;310;(There is ample evidence, however, that several weeks earlier Azevedo had been negotiating with and on behalf of the Argentina.)
MusicBO;50;360;The rustic setting, as later in La sonnambula, heralds a tragi-comedy, the opera semiseria genre so popular in this period.
MusicBO;50;364;Indeed Rossini develops the characters quite carefully, avoiding both the exaggerations of buffo style and the postures of opera seria.
MusicBO;50;344;Dandini, the servant dressed as the prince and trying to sound like him, is more subtle and more amusing.
MusicBO;50;386;Giannetto could come to know the strengths of his company and the strengths of his company could develop together.
MusicBO;50;488;Perhaps the most remarkable number in these operas is the first-act ‘terzettone’ (as Rossini called it) in Maometto II,
MusicBO;50;610;Only the Countess's aria, ‘En proie à la tristesse’, borrowed from Il viaggio a Reims, features virtuoso solo writing.
MusicBO;50;637;The extensive spectacular elements, ballets and processions derive from French operatic tradition, but are effectively integrated into the opera.
MusicBO;50;756;The Prélude prétentieux is just that, with a fugal subject and development that parody one contrapuntal cliché after another.
MusicBO;50;843;documentary material has also made his music newly accessible, both the eternally popular comic works and the serious operas.
MusicBO;50;435;They all specialized in florid singing that could be dazzling in its splendour but monotonous in its ubiquity.
MusicBO;50;788;From 1857 until his death, Rossini was among subscribers to the critical edition of the works of Bach.
MusicBO;50;39;Gioachino later reported to his friend Edmond Michotte that Mattei considered him the ‘dishonour of his school’.
MusicBO;50;216;The initial clash is presented in parallel poetic stanzas, normally set to the same or similar music.
MusicBO;50;411;but rather its French adaptation by J.F. Ducis, the version commonly known throughout Europe at the time.
MusicBO;50;437;Attention given to this aspect of Rossini's art was intensified by his personal relations with Isabella Colbran.
MusicBO;50;586;Having to learn French and master the intricacies of its declamation, Rossini approached his new task gingerly.
MusicBO;50;10;His immediate paternal ancestors can be traced in Lugo, while his mother's family came from Urbino.
MusicBO;50;25;Under Malerbi's direction Rossini began studying composition, and Giuseppe wrote a considerable number of sacred pieces.
MusicBO;50;49;On these occasions the Liceo Rossini sometimes supplied arias for insertion into the operas being performed.
MusicBO;50;333;There is the delightful incongruity of form and content in the trio ‘Ah! qual colpo inaspettato!
MusicBO;50;365;Ninetta's simplicity, even when overwhelmed by events, differentiates her entirely from his earlier, more sophisticated heroines.
MusicBO;50;538;Semiramide is one of the few Rossini operas whose genesis can be followed in some detail.
MusicBO;50;549;A Rossini season was organized at the King's Theatre, but many of the operas were unsuccessful.
MusicBO;50;550;Zelmira made a particularly poor impression because of the inadequacy of Colbran in the title role.
MusicBO;50;580;Only a few performances of Il viaggio a Reims were given before Rossini withdrew the score.
MusicBO;50;600;Instead Rossini tended to compose larger units in which solo voices and chorus combine more dramatically.
MusicBO;50;633;Nonetheless, the opera as a whole is a rich tapestry of the composer's most inspired music.
MusicBO;50;649;The financial security the Liceo Rossini had now gained may also have been a contributory cause.
MusicBO;50;102;In the 16 months from L'equivoco stravagante to Il signor Bruschino, Rossini composed seven operas.
MusicBO;50;131;Alongside the comic elements is the sentimental vein that pervades much of Rossini's opera buffa.
MusicBO;50;591;An honorary post was created for him as premier compositeur du roi and inspecteur général
MusicBO;50;724;The revolutionary movements that swept Italy in 1848 marked a significant turning-point in Rossini's life.
MusicBO;50;111;In the farse and comic operas, however, Rossini's musical personality began to take shape.
MusicBO;50;122;The comic characters in many of these early works are complex and well differentiated.
MusicBO;50;170;Rossini's first two operas to win international acclaim were written consecutively for Venetian theatres:
MusicBO;50;197;Amenaide contemplates her joy in a lyrical period, first expressively, then in exuberant coloratura.
MusicBO;50;438;When Rossini arrived in Naples, the Liceo Rossini appears to have been Barbaia's mistress.
MusicBO;50;459;Though Guillaume Tell is Rossini's most ambitious opera, its basis is laid in Naples.
MusicBO;50;603;Three of the four original arias in Mosè in Egitto were omitted for Paris.
MusicBO;50;700;The first Italian performance, at Bologna, followed in March under the direction of Donizetti.
MusicBO;50;711;‘Quando corpus morietur’, with its sinking chromatic lines, the final choral fugue on ‘
MusicBO;50;108;What is remarkable is how much fine music how much fine music contain.
MusicBO;50;118;But sometimes, especially in these earlier works, the orchestral bustle seems rather faceless.
MusicBO;50;274;Il crociato in Egitto of 1824, one of the last significant castrato roles.
MusicBO;50;308;There are attractive elements in this rescue opera, but its reception was mediocre.
MusicBO;50;412;Even the first two acts provide the composer with some wonderful musical opportunities:
MusicBO;50;484;Central to Rossini's reform, though, is the internal expansion of the musical unit.
MusicBO;50;517;The significance of this approach for later Italian composers needs hardly be stressed.
MusicBO;50;543;Rossini left Italy as the most important and popular composer of his time.
MusicBO;50;667;In this sickness the Liceo Rossini was nursed and comforted by Olympe Pélissier.
MusicBO;50;770;A large number of these songs were originally written to the ‘Mi lagnerò
MusicBO;50;4;His contemporaries recognized him as the greatest Italian composer of his time.
MusicBO;50;276;Enraged, the composer vowed thenceforth to write out all ornamentation in full.
MusicBO;50;464;From a dramaturgical viewpoint, the Neapolitan operas are strikingly original and diverse.
MusicBO;50;688;His only activity was as honorary consultant to the Bologna Liceo Musicale.
MusicBO;50;726;Prompted by demonstrations directed against them, the Rossinis left Bologna for Florence.
MusicBO;50;825;Until recently the image of Rossini as man and artist was distorted.
MusicBO;50;181;There is little in Semiramide whose roots cannot be traced here.
MusicBO;50;242;Not all the music of Tancredi partakes in these formal conventions.
MusicBO;50;326;The opera soon gained an enormous success that has never diminished.
MusicBO;50;385;Giannetto could write more deliberately and be assured of adequate rehearsals.
MusicBO;50;534;After his Viennese stay, Rossini parted company with Barbaia and Naples.
MusicBO;50;687;But the death of his father in 1839 further weakened Rossini.
MusicBO;50;783;I was born for opera buffa, you know opera buffa well!
MusicBO;50;835;Between 1810 and 1850 Italian opera was reformed in many ways.
MusicBO;50;840;This material has greatly enriched our understanding of Rossini's artistic career.
MusicBO;51;47;In the decree marking the end of the suspension of that group, special mention was made of Torelli and Pistocchi, who were to be paid for each function at which they performed when they were in the city rather than being held to regular, continual service.
MusicBO;51;46;Nothing is known of Torelli's travels until February 1701, when he was listed as a violinist in the newly re-formed S Petronio cappella musicale, directed by Perti.
MusicBO;51;55;Between 1686 and 1692, while Girolamo Nicolò Laurenti, Pietro Bettinozzi and Francesco Manfredini was in Bologna, Torelli published five collections of works entitled sonatas, sinfonias and concertos.
MusicBO;51;45;On 5 May 1700 Pistocchi wrote that he and Torelli were returning to Ansbach, hoping to obtain permission from the margrave to return to Italy.
MusicBO;51;4;Italian composer arrived at his mature concerto style through his chamber music, which shows some experimental steps towards concerto techniques.
MusicBO;51;43;Torelli spoke of wishing to make a pilgrimage to Loreto, and of wanting to drink the waters at S Marino

MusicBO;56;1180;In the nineteenth century, research in the archives of the Capranica family in Rome, divided between the Capitoline Historical Archive and the Theatrical Archive of Burcardo, has offered interesting data on the mechanisms of theatrical circulation, to which has been added precious news on music and theater in various Italian cities, thanks to the family's correspondence.86
MusicBO;56;205;For reasons of space, however, I will not be able to include those numerous contributions relative to single documents, especially those of a biographical nature, issued more or less regularly by musicological periodicals, or which appeared in conference reports dedicated to a single musician.4
MusicBO;56;66;Finally This essay focuses on a recent experience of musico-historical research based on this type of source—a collective volume on music in Rome published in 1994, thanks to a joint effort of the Roman State Archive and the Italian Musicological Society.
MusicBO;56;948;For medieval music, some significant documents from the Ufficio corone ed armi, dated 1264 and 1284-1381, for example, are kept in the collection Curia del Podestà of the State archive of Bologna, where they have systematically been examined by Alessandra Fiori.66
MusicBO;56;165;Many studies, based on this type of source, have outlined the history of court musical chapels and of Italian religious institutions, as well as the various forms of musical patronage practiced by individuals or by families.
MusicBO;56;224;Among congress reports recently published, see those on Domenico Zipoli and on Giovanni Legrenzi in the series Quaderni della Rivista Italiana di Musicologia, and those on Giuseppe Tartini issued by II Mulino in 1994.

MusicBO;56;203;I would like to indicate some other studies, published since 1990, or still underway, which are chiefly based on archival sources, linking them to the description of the Italian archives put forth above.
MusicBO;56;566;The archival research in this field will be brought together in the forthcoming Dizionario degli editori musicali italiani, promoted by the Italian Musicological Society and edited by Bianca Maria Antolini and Stanley Boorman.

MusicBO;58;172;A letter from Jommelli to Padre Martini, dated Stuttgart, February 23, 1759, was presumably written in response to an inquiry as to Lolli's status at Wiirttemberg.

MusicBO;60;3789;One has never yet read or heard the recognition that the most popular and satisfying form, the concerto for solo keyboard instrument and orchestra, originated in the fifth Brandenburg Concerto, in the arrangements for solo harpsichord or two harpsichords of Italian and other concertos, and in Bach's original works for the instruments.
MusicBO;60;970;Pietro degli ANTONII (1486-1720) does not seem to have composed concerti grossi himself, but is important as one of the first to specialize in sonatas for a single violin with so rhapsodic and lyrical a melodic line that the organ or harpsichord part is purely a harmonic support. '
MusicBO;60;4462;It was cheaper, perhaps, to order more than one set of parts when a society's meetings used two or more desks of violas and 'cellos, for the players who shared a desk did not normally share the part when the players who shared a desk practised at home.
MusicBO;60;1850;The suites mentioned above and many others composed by Germans contain better music than much by Lully, Colasse, Campra and Destouches which inspired them, and better music than we find in most of the Italian sonatas and concertos we have so far discussed.
MusicBO;60;3464;and we therefore refer to him in discussions of the galant and empfindsamer styles a distinction which means little if we are determined to classify compositions of the period, but which gives us insight into the minds of vital musicians.
MusicBO;60;969;His importance to other musicians was evidently in leadership, for Pietro degli ANTONII (1486-1720) was a greatly respected personality, often elected president of the Accademia Filarmonica during the years when the concerto grosso spread throughout Italy and Europe.
MusicBO;60;4358;Many German musicians sought a livelihood in Great Britain, even as far north as Aberdeen, which had a flourishing music society very much like Avison's at Newcastle, its performing members being largely drawn from the nobility and gentry.
MusicBO;60;5020;Similarly we should be careful not to pretend that Handel's movements are Beethovenian because Handel's movements are often dramatic, often include passages of motivic development and often show energy and urgency that is rarely found before Beethoven. '
MusicBO;60;2223;If Albinoni had differed from Vivaldi as Bach differed from Handel he would have attracted more attention, but the two Venetians were active in the same fields as violinists and as composers of opera and of concertos.
MusicBO;60;997;His compositions include operas, cantatas, oratorios, masses and sets of what were often reprinted as sonatas but were originally called Suonate da camera and Sinfonie a due e tre instrument^ the latter being canzonalike and contrapuntal.
MusicBO;60;1430;the printed sheets were evidently well known already, for it is difficult not to believe that the printed sheets had an influence upon Albinoni's concertos, published in 1700, as the printed sheets certainly had upon DalFAbaco's.

MusicBO;60;130;Concerti grossi were aggrandizements of the more integral sound of the trio sonata for violins and 'cello, which Corelli incorporated into his concertos by making it persistent in the fabric and exposed as a concertino.

MusicBO;60;1562;the next four prescribe 'un violino obbligato' and some of the solo episodes are more virtuosic, especially in their fast arpeggiando passages, than any of Torelli's 5 the last four are 'con due violini obbligati'.
MusicBO;60;1644;The only truth in such phrases lies in the fact that many listeners, including some who later composed concertos, first enjoyed the antithesis of a string orchestra and a concertino when they heard Corelli's concertos.
MusicBO;60;2186;By his operas, by the concerts in which his father led performances of his own works, and by accepting as pupils the nobility of Germany or their chamber musicians, Vivaldi could have lived in luxury.
MusicBO;60;4970;In each of these superb works the four, five or six movements seem like facets of one personality 5 so we have twelve essays of an integrity comparable with that of the best classical symphonies.

MusicBO;77;508;This was also the time that other famous Bolognese artists such as Annibale Carracci, and later Guido Reni, Francesco Albani, and Domenichino, were in Rome promoting their new brand of classical naturalism in opposition to Caravaggio’s more controversial hyperrealism.
MusicBO;77;2288;The portrait of Sirani that Pulini attributes to Cantofoli (1650s–60s) is related to an engraved copy by Lorenzo Tinti (one of Sirani’s students, discussed in chapter 5) of a self-portrait of Sirani in the act of painting her father.87
MusicBO;77;1049;Divisions arose between the orders regarding this point, the Dominicans remaining typically more conservative, whereas the Franciscans, being an order deeply involved in outreach to help the poor, were often closer to the beliefs of pious common people.
MusicBO;77;1368;In terms of prestige, the icon could also be associated with the proceedings of the Council of Ferrara in 1438, where the eastern patriarch sought protection from the Turks and the faithful prayed to their icon for deliverance.
MusicBO;77;948;This directive implies attitude toward personal prayer and meditation that has links with both devotio moderna and the spiritual exercises of Loyola, as mentioned above, thus reflecting Paleotti’s ideas on two key movements of Christian spirituality.
MusicBO;77;1539;A closer examination of the embroidered copy, Madonna and Child with St. Marta (Figs. 3.3–3.4) rewards us with further insights into the hybridity of this artwork and its ties to the visual culture of the city.

MusicBO;77;264;The attention to minute detail, luminous colour, and pious mood that Flemish painting was known for would have appealed greatly to a Bolognese cleric like Paleotti, who sought truth and verisimilitude in the visual arts.
MusicBO;77;2096;The Madonna of the Rosario in the Guidotti Chapel in the Church of San Domenico was maintained by a noblewoman from the Malvezzi family, who was also the rector of the Confraternity of the Rosary.45
MusicBO;77;2195;It brings to mind the many unique images and portraits of children created by Fontana such as the Child in a Cradle, displaying a growing interest in the representation of childhood in a sacred context.
MusicBO;77;2565;For these reasons, the commission for the Museo was undoubtedly a crucial one for Fontana’s career, considering the widespread diffusion of the text and the importance of the erudite subject matter and its noble patron.
MusicBO;77;763;In the Discorso Paleotti went so far as to define different types of sacred images, of which the Sindone (the Shroud of Turin), and the Veil of Veronica are two of the most important.

MusicBO;77;3967;“When we look at works of the nuns who wrote, painted, sculpted, organized performances, and played music, the convent appears to have been more of a catalyst for female cultural production than an impediment.
MusicBO;77;324;Reasons for its heightened status include the prominence of its university and the community of scholars that surrounded it, which comprised the likes of the naturalist Ulisse Aldrovandi and the historian Carlo Sigonio.2
MusicBO;77;515;Ciaconio had also invited Paleotti to Rome to see a recently discovered ancient Christian catacomb, and the two remained in close contact thanks to a mutual interest in early Christian archaeology in Rome.54
MusicBO;77;860;The cat, by contrast, had no such sacred purpose confirmed by official biblical sources, other than a folk legend that tells of a litter of kittens born at the same time as Christ.
MusicBO;77;356;Thus, when Paleotti wished to reform the religious imagery created in his city by writing his Discorso, Paleotti openly sought advice not only from clerics but from painters and scientists as well.

MusicBO;77;1824;In sum, the conservatori were places where women could take care of other women, weaving a sacred tapestry of feminine virtue, with the assistance of a specific visual imaginary of their own.
MusicBO;77;2094;For example, the Patarazzi family commissioned from Sirani an altarpiece for their chapel in the Church of San Biagio, the same church for which Fontana had painted her Birth of the Virgin.44
MusicBO;77;2815;In the history of games before their prohibition in the early modern period, their most remote origins date from antiquity, and thanks to this heritage, These games were seen as respectable pastimes.

MusicBO;77;2736;Also significant is that many of Mitelli’s prints contain verses in Bolognese dialect, reinforcing the site-specific moralistic message of his games and creating a complex interweaving of image, text, and morality.

MusicBO;77;2088;As far back as 1513, the pious noblewoman Elena Duglioli was the patron for Raphael’s Ecstasy of St. Cecilia, painted for the Bolognese church of San Giovanni in Monte.

MusicBO;77;1547;The embroidered version created a real hybrid combining visual motifs drawn not only from book illustration in the emblematic Bolognese tradition, but also from painting, print, and fabric.
MusicBO;77;1724;This imagery can also be associated with the devices of other meditative practices such as memory theatre, devotio moderna, and the spiritual exercises of St Ignatius of Loyola.
MusicBO;77;1890;Sirani made an etching of this painting, which allowed the image to be widely disseminated, thus propagating an important aspect of Marian devotion for personal piety and meditation.
MusicBO;77;2437;Eventually this iconography became especially popular in the seventeenth century in images of pious females and saints such as Suor Cecilia of Nocera and St Teresa of Avila.

MusicBO;77;665;Compared to other treatises of the day on visual reform, Cardinal Paleotti’s Discorso intorno alle immagini sacre e profane was as unique as its author’s own formation.
MusicBO;77;684;My analysis also considers the additional evidence in the extant index for the final three books of the first version of the Discorso, which were never completed.
MusicBO;77;988;He knew that active images required beautiful colour and design to persuade, not with falsity, but with the beauty of the truth as contained in sacred scripture.

MusicBO;77;2811;From mentions in period literature to behavioural treatises such as Castiglione’s Courtier and even more elaborate tracts written specifically on games, their pedigree is long and complex.58
MusicBO;77;2990;In the process, Mitelli’s prints speak to both high and low audiences and employ a sense of local Bolognese naturalism to persuade the viewer of their message.
MusicBO;77;3697;This is ironic since it seems that in this case, even the taint of heresy could be cleansed from an icon by its popularity among the faithful.
MusicBO;77;106;Many thanks also go to the institutions and individuals who kindly gave me permission to reproduce the great works in their collections, galleries, museums, and churches.
MusicBO;77;886;The Latin version of his Discorso, which came out in 1595, was double the size of the vernacular version, given the number of iconographic examples included.
MusicBO;77;907;That movement was started by Gerard Groote (1409–1443), a monk from Windesheim in the Netherlands, in response to urban poverty and the corruption of the clergy.59
MusicBO;77;1936;Another saint with special meaning to women was Mary Magdalene, whose repentance served as a role model for women in Bologna active in the religious community.
MusicBO;77;2140;The Holy Trinity with St. Martin (1669) depicts the bishop with eyes glazed over in a pious expression and rolled up to glance at the heavens.
MusicBO;77;2403;These exotic views of the eastern female were often created for the delectation of male Western viewers, as in the later nineteenth-century tradition of the odalisque.
MusicBO;77;2514;Cospi and Legati were still pursuing the path followed by Aldrovandi, which dictated that as many objects as possible should be illustrated as accurately as possible.
MusicBO;77;2528;In a certain sense, the text was itself a type of Wunderkammer in the form of a book that contained an encyclopedic microcosm of the universe.
MusicBO;77;3683;Fontana’s altarpiece is mentioned as being in the church of San Pietro in the first edition of Malvasia, but we lose track of it after 1755.
MusicBO;77;3767;The frescoes have unfortunately not survived, but Bianchi gives us as complete a description as possible based on the writings by Paleotti in the Isolani archives.
MusicBO;77;4128;Religious paintings, when illustrating a particular biblical narrative, were considered to have the same importance as history paintings in the hierarchy of genres at the time.
MusicBO;77;4175;"; Caterina Patarazzi commissioned the altarpiece for the Confraternity of the Madonna delle Neve for a church of the same name and their hospital for pilgrims."
MusicBO;77;680;However, the clearest evidence of such cooperation is to be found in the paintings themselves, the most important artifacts of visual culture in this case.
MusicBO;77;720;His fourth book was to contain specific instructions on how to portray the various saints, on the basis of available information such as hagiographic sources.
MusicBO;77;853;We can only speculate on whether Paleotti turned a blind eye to this, since he did ask Barocci to paint the altarpiece for his chapel.
MusicBO;77;1287;An unusual altarpiece in Fontana’s oeuvre is the Gnetti Pala or Altarpiece, also known as the Consecration to the Virgin and Child with Saints (1599).
MusicBO;77;1291;This type of altarpiece would have taken on special importance in relation to the Christian institutes of charitable reform for girls that proliferated in Bologna.
MusicBO;77;1490;The chosen iconography was also indicative of convent reform, with its emphasis on certain female saints as role models for the salvation of women’s virtue.
MusicBO;77;1635;The history of these institutions for young women and the imagery produced by their residents is also closely tied to the story of their patronage.
MusicBO;77;1649;For example, Virginia Cospi of the Bolognese Cospi family donated a mulino and any revenues that the mill generated to the Putte of Santa Croce.
MusicBO;77;2417;One important piece of information not noted by previous scholars is that several initials appear as signatures throughout the text, including those of Veronica Fontana.
MusicBO;77;2500;One could say that the arrangement was meant to provoke meraviglia in a similar way that a religious miracle could elicit wonder from the faithful.
MusicBO;77;2655;In order for the miracle to be convincing, the audience must suspend disbelief and allow itself to be persuaded of the veracity of the mountain.
MusicBO;77;2676;The feast consisted of the spectacle of a bullfight with forty armed hunters and dogs chasing two bulls that had been loosed in the piazza.
MusicBO;77;2746;This game is closely related to the tradition of moralizing broadsheets such as the miserable end of the courtesan, a theme especially popular in Venice.52
MusicBO;77;2956;Its subject matter also exists in courtly parlour games such as The Game of Trades, in which players are asked to mime a particular trade.
MusicBO;77;3009;This sense of naturalism was already inherent in both the Bolognese and Lombard schools, beginning with Leonardo and continuing on with Caravaggio and the Carracci.
MusicBO;77;3790;The figure of St Francis is very similar to that of St Benedict by Angela Teresa Muratori in her painting The Miracle of St. Benedict.
MusicBO;77;454;Mythological though this attempt was, in other areas Aldrovandi did make great strides in scientific categorization, including classifying many items from the New World.
MusicBO;77;611;early paintings reveal her intense interest in a naturalism that was obviously fostered by her contact with Aldrovandi and the scientific culture of Bologna.
MusicBO;77;1131;The heavens open up to a cone of divine light, which can be described as an almost scientific depiction of the phenomenon of light.
MusicBO;77;1219;"Three examples stand out: Christ with the Magdalene in the Noli Me Tangere; Christ and the Canaanite Woman; and Christ and the Samaritan Woman."
MusicBO;77;1366;This icon was from Constantinople, the city of the mythic eastern tradition also thought of as the second Rome and heir of early Christianity.
MusicBO;77;1417;I discuss below the particular iconography of the two examples of religious paintings by Lavinia Fontana and Elisabetta Sirani that exist in embroidered copies.
MusicBO;77;1574;These images are combinations of the sacred and the genre scene, in the pious tradition of early Netherlandish works such as Robert Campin’s Merode
MusicBO;77;1811;These virgins had an enormous impact on the city’s reputation for sanctity, since women’s honour was inherently tied to the virtue of their city.
MusicBO;77;1963;It is also a rare example of a painting that illustrates the importance of icons and the Byzantine tradition to the Counter-Reformation dogma, and
MusicBO;77;2287;that emphasizes her learning and sophistication, choosing in this case to display erudite texts and dress herself in the splendour appropriate to a maestra.
MusicBO;77;2391;However, for most of the texts that she illustrated, she used the woodcut technique since this best accommodated the incorporation of illustrations with text.
MusicBO;77;2717;These printed edicts were posted to inform the public of restrictions and prohibitions on gambling in the Papal States of Rome, Bologna, and Perugia.
MusicBO;77;2961;When compared to the iconic images of the trades in Brambilla’s game of Pela il chiu, this version has a very different graphic effect.
MusicBO;77;3005;In such a climate Paleotti could not afford to ignore any knowledge that might have been advantageous in the Church’s campaign for visual reform.
MusicBO;77;5008;In From Van Eyck to Breugel: Early Netherlandish Painting in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, edited by Maryan Wynn Ainsworth and Keith Christiansen, 39–58.

MusicBO;77;338;This philosophy stems from his scientific background, which was rooted in empirical observation, as well as from the contemporary Bolognese interest in emblems.
MusicBO;77;405;Aldrovandi thus advocates a realism that is perfectly in tune with Paleotti’s version of a naturalism that has the veracity of history painting.
MusicBO;77;1591;For example, Fontana’s Birth of the Virgin was commissioned by the Ghelli family, and Dorotea Ghelli became a teacher at one of these
MusicBO;77;1718;In Counter-Reformation imagery, the stanza del lavoro, or the workroom, is also seen as the stanza dell’anima, or the room of the soul.
MusicBO;77;2095;It was theses women of the city also who encouraged charity for institutions such as the Baraccano and the Putte di Santa Marta.
MusicBO;77;2129;Aesclepius would thus have been a perfect vehicle for the eulogization of Muratori’s father, a doctor and professor of medicine at the university.
MusicBO;77;2732;The apparatus of these games is usually a broadsheet, and all are played with a number of dice ranging from one to three.
MusicBO;77;2848;Although not as obviously as in some of Mitelli’s other games, this example also contains moralistic messages encoded within its illustrations and text.
MusicBO;77;3014;Some artists in the city lost no time in applying this style to religious painting, as we have seen in Fontana’s St. Francis.
MusicBO;77;3950;After 1621 they had a rotating sede, and by the early 1700s they met in the house of Giovanni Francesco Rossi Poggi Marsigli.
MusicBO;77;4267;Thanks to Babette Bohn for alerting me to the drawing by Ludovico Carracci, Miracle of St. John, on which Pinelli’s painting is based.
MusicBO;77;471;In this program Paleotti would have seen eye-to-eye with Aldrovandi, who saw no conflict between his Catholic faith and his scientific pursuits.
MusicBO;77;1030;These Marian themes were also treated by various other artists, illustrating different approaches to the problem of representing this important iconographic tradition.
MusicBO;77;1510;The painting is unique as a document that carries traces of collaboration between generations of women and the manifestation of their piety.
MusicBO;77;1653;The Opera dei Poveri Vergognosi, which originally met in the Church of San Domenico, later moved to the Church of Santa Maria
MusicBO;77;1991;Sirani also created a portrait of Signora Ortensia Leoni Cordini as St Dorothy (1661),25 including only the necessary attributes in the portrait.
MusicBO;77;2510;One can glimpse the aesthetic of this organizational style in the book’s frontispiece, created by Fontana’s colleague Giuseppe Maria Mitelli (Fig. i.3).
MusicBO;77;2691;The natural function of the volcano was transformed into a perfect Christian allegory, as was appropriate to a city in Counter-Reformation times.
MusicBO;77;2839;Among most game prints of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, in contrast, one can find similar subject matter translated into visual images.
MusicBO;77;3027;This pattern is evident in his employment of Fontana as the creator of the altarpiece of the Assumption for his own chapel.
MusicBO;77;3944;Much of this information is to be found in the Libro Bianco (the white book), which survives in a copy from 1720.

MusicBO;77;274;Fontana herself was familiar with Calvaert’s work in addition to the paintings of her father, Prospero, who had worked with Calvaert.
MusicBO;77;332;His Ornithologiae was published in three volumes, 1599–1603, and included an elaborate engraved portrait by Agostino Carracci for the frontispiece (Fig.

MusicBO;77;874;This interest will be treated further when we examine the martyr frescoes in the crypt of San Pietro that Paleotti commissioned.
MusicBO;77;958;In this, Paleotto displays a continued sense of Christian humanism by not entirely dismissing ancient art, but simply qualifying its use.
MusicBO;77;1159;However, when called upon to create an altarpiece for Paleotti’s chapel, her work was the epitome of the artefice cristiano (Fig.

MusicBO;77;1749;The nun-writer Arcangela Tarabotti, who lived in the Convent of Sant’Anna in Venice, left a detailed personal record of convent life.
MusicBO;77;1754;And, as one would expect from the Bolognese tradition of naturalism, ornamental designs such as flowers were taken directly from nature.

MusicBO;77;2266;An example is her Beatrice Cenci (1650s), a painting long attributed to Guido Reni (and at one point, also to Sirani).
MusicBO;77;2322;One of the biggest festivals in Bologna, the Festa della Porchetta (Pork Festival), was held on St Bartholomew’s Day in August.
MusicBO;77;2349;The Martyrdom of St. Colomba, The Games of Samson, and Esther – and Cristo morto was for Santa Maria della Morte.
MusicBO;77;2355;Esther would fit in perfectly with the other more familiar biblical female role models of virtue or femmes fortes, previously discussed.
MusicBO;77;2364;This development will be demonstrated in the work of Sirani’s student Veronica Fontana, as well as her colleague Giuseppe Maria Mitelli.
MusicBO;77;2428;This woodcut is an example of Veronica Fontana’s images as used in book production, where the woodcut medium was most appropriate.
MusicBO;77;2968;Further research would be required to substantiate this, since Mitelli was extremely prolific and thus may have had a good income.78
MusicBO;77;2987;In my emphasis on female artists I don’t mean to leave male artists completely out of the picture, so to speak.

MusicBO;77;793;Both in Prospero’s opinion and in that of Michelangelo’s defenders, albeit for different reasons, the artist was exonerated from blame.
MusicBO;77;968;religious paintings can be placed into these three categories, which only occasionally overlap but do have a common element: science.
MusicBO;77;993;Dead Christ with the Symbols of the Passion was based on Taddeo Zuccari’s version of the subject, through Calvaert’s engraving.
MusicBO;77;1211;In her religious narrative, Fontana only included details that would be necessary to get the Christian message across to viewers.
MusicBO;77;1297;A further category of religious portraiture in this period consists of paintings that deal with apocryphal biblical and historical heroines.
MusicBO;77;1514;These types of site-specific work highlighting women’s virtue continued to be created in the seventeenth century by and for women.
MusicBO;77;1582;For example, the artist depicts a little girl warming the linens in which to swaddle the newborn by the fire.
MusicBO;77;2297;In this self-portrait the canvas functions as a two-way mirror, allowing the artist to embody the allegory of painting itself.
MusicBO;77;2367;Sirani’s students and colleagues, both male and female, were greatly involved in this endeavour through book illustration and popular prints.
MusicBO;77;2725;In these games, one would follow a spiral path, which led to the centre by way of passes or setbacks.

MusicBO;96;139;In addition to the general table, other data are scattered throughout the book.
MusicBO;96;235;In several instances, conservatories were founded to alleviate shortages in the local orchestra.
MusicBO;96;210;With Angelo Mariani conducting, several Meyerbeer operas were produced during the 1860s.
MusicBO;96;233;Some orchestra contracts stipulated that the first chair players provide free instruction.
MusicBO;104;4904;Perhaps this explains to some extent the nature of his vast output (some 400 works of every description), its variety and also its inequalities, the latter due to the fact that Honegger is in the habit of publishing, without discrimination, not only his most carefully thought out and 'finished' compositions, but also mere hastily executed sketches which sometimes give the impression of being laboratory experiments.
MusicBO;104;26;"However interesting the lives of some of the great musicians may be, there is plenty of information about the most famous of them available to those who seek it; what is of primary importance is to throw light upon their creative activities and on the part the great musicians have played in the development of their art."
MusicBO;104;514;The result is that, for us, the interpretation of these songs, as regards rhythm, is a controversial question, although the most commonly accepted theory is the one based on the metre in which the poems are written, each song being composed according to a rhythmic mode corresponding to one of the classic Latin poetic metres.
MusicBO;104;4025;And yet it is highly probable that certain of his works will survive, notably such constructional masterpieces as the Symphony with organ and the concertos and solo pieces in which the resources of the instrument are exploited with a skill which will ensure their popularity with virtuosi for a long time to come.
MusicBO;104;4189;"His total output consists of some 50 pieces for the piano, the most important of which are the Theme et Variations, the Ballade and the 13 Nocturnes; 2 Sonatas for piano and violin, 2 for piano and 'cello; one trio; 2 quartets and 2 quintets for piano and strings; and a string quartet."
MusicBO;104;5274;Among his numerous pupils were Tilliere, the two Jansons, Cupis the younger, and JeanPierre Duport, known as Duport I'aine who was one of the first to undertake concert tours abroad and who was invited by Frederick II of Prussia to Berlin, where he stayed from 1773 until his death in 1818.
MusicBO;104;468;Another influence that has been suggested is that of the songs sung all over Europe by the itinerant monks and clerks known as the Goliards who were, however, more or less discredited through their association with the jongleurs and generally in revolt against the Church, which treated them severely.
MusicBO;104;5102;He was the first to write motets in which all the voices are governed by the principle of isorhythmics (which consisted originally in allotting to the 'liturgical tenor' part (canto fermo) a rhythmic design that remained unchanged from beginning to end, whatever modifications its melodic outline may have undergone.
MusicBO;104;2018;At the age of ten Purcell became a choir-boy at the Chapel Royal, and at 21 was appointed organist of Westminster Abbey, a post which Purcell held, combining organist of Westminster Abbey, a post which he held with other high offices, until his death in 1695.
MusicBO;104;3881;The movement started (as the result of a competition arranged by the publisher Sanzogno) with the sudden revelation of an opera which embodied all the characteristics, good and bad, of the new style in their most extreme form: this was Cavalleria Rusticana (1890) by Pietro Mascagni.
MusicBO;104;4487;"His early works showed a definite predilection for corrosive harmonies and aggressive rhythms (the Sarcasmes for piano, the Scythian Suite, Chout, Le Pas d'Acier); but during the same period the Symphonie classique, Visions fugitives and whole movements in the piano sonatas reflect a more tranquil mood."
MusicBO;104;1682;Of the Cantate ed arie a voce sola of Alessandro Grandi, the first ones published under this title in 1620 were simply concert arias in strophic form, with the bass repeating itself in each strophe, while the upper part changed from one verse to another.
MusicBO;104;605;The progress made in the thirteenth century by the music of the Troubadours, the increased flexibility of rhythm, and the fact that instrumental dances were written down, were all signs, among others, of an emancipation from which secular music was going to benefit most.
MusicBO;104;919;After that he travelled in Italy, Flanders, Germany, England and France until in 1550 he accepted the post of choir master at the Court of Bavaria and settled in Munich where he remained, except for short periods of absence, until his death in 1594.
MusicBO;104;2329;"In his Magnificat, and in his Hymnes de VEglise pour toucher sur Vorgue (1623) he makes use of dissonance just as—to quote his own words—""a painter employs shading in his pictures so as to throw into greater relief the brightness and light of day""."
MusicBO;104;4312;"He was also the prototype of the amateur musician, of whom there were many in this school;—of noble birth, self-taught, or at any rate not Conservatory trained (Russia had none before 1862), he managed to acquire enough technique to enable him to produce masterpieces."
MusicBO;104;4922;Another, and not the least of Poulenc's singularities, is the parallelism constantly maintained between a sincere religious and mystical inspiration and the popular, sarcastic and, on occasion, licentious vein manifested in the Chansons Gaillardes, the Mamelles de Tiresias or the Piano Concerto of 1949.
MusicBO;104;4229;Schmitt wrote an enormous quantity of music in every genre, ranging from monumental compositions like the Psalm, the Quintet and the String Quartet to small vocal and instrumental pieces in which the craftmanship is as delicate and fine as in anything of Ravel's.
MusicBO;104;4618;In the Violin Concerto (1935) the last movement of which is based on a Bach choral, Berg succeeded in blending more intimately than ever before expressionism and absolute music on the one hand, and dodecaphony and the old tonal system on the other.
MusicBO;104;5120;It was probably their desire to reserve for themselves a language accessible only to the initiated that led the old contrapuntists to cultivate assiduously the 'enigmatic' canon whose solution was only to be found in a 'puzzle phrase' or an unusual graphic presentation.
MusicBO;104;5243;A ballet of the kind that was danced at Carnival time, in which the King would take part, generally consisted of some thirty entrees in groups of four or five, each group beginning with a recit (other recits might be sung in between).
MusicBO;104;1437;More detailed still is the account given by Massimo Trojano of the festivities held at Munich in 1568 on the occasion of the marriage of Duke William of Bavaria to Renee de Lorraine, with Orlando di Lasso as director of music.
MusicBO;104;1507;These researches were not confined to musicians, for the latter had occasion to compare their views with those of poets, philosophers and learned men in the Academies and clubs where all the arts and all branches of science were freely discussed.
MusicBO;104;4919;In addition, he had a most remarkable instinct for piano writing and vocal declamation : the Mouvements perpetuels, composed in 1918 at the age of 19, and the Bestiaire, written the following year, would have done credit to an experienced composer.
MusicBO;104;69;the Roman Church was found that an excellent method of assisting worshippers to pray together was to base the prayer on a very simple chant, very much in the nature of a recitation designed on simple rhythmic and melodic lines.
MusicBO;104;2335;"The two last mentioned, however, belong to the middle of the eighteenth century which, as regards French organ music, was a period of decadence and of a style that was agreeable and polite, sometimes called ""galant"" and sometimes ""rocaille"" or"
MusicBO;104;3896;"in the triptych II Tabarro, Suor Angelica and Gianni Schicchi, the last of which reveals a rare sense of humour; and finally in Turandot, a work whose bold harmonies, exotic atmosphere and rich colouring combine to make it Puccini's masterpiece."
MusicBO;104;4118;The dramatic conception of Pelleas, the declamation, the harmony, the orchestration sounded a sufficiently new note to explain the dismay of the public in 1902, and the enthusiasm of the handful of fervent admirers who finally overcame the massive opposition.
MusicBO;104;692;This resulted in an interchange of influences which it is not always easy to disentangle, while the extraordinary amalgamation of national cultures and interests due to the Hundred Years War makes it more difficult still to establish the balance.
MusicBO;104;1950;Keiser also wrote opera-comiques, such as die Leipziger Messe, der Hamburger Jahrmarkt, der lacherliche Prinz Jodelet, which were the ancestors of the Singspiel which did not begin to be fully developed until the second half of the eighteenth century.
MusicBO;104;2242;It was about this time that Vivaldi began to write concertos, the first book of which, the Estro armonico, Op. 3, did not appear until 1712 although parts of it, at least, had been in circulation for some years.
MusicBO;104;2151;"It is probably Michel de la Barre who is standing in the centre turning the pages of a score bearing the inscription ''''Trio de M. de la Barre, Sonate en trio pour la flute traver (siere), Premiere Sonate""."

MusicBO;120;2026;In the previous chapter I argued that Leopardi saw a penchant for theatricality as a defining trait of early nineteenth- century Italian society, whose members generally preferred the different forms of public spectacle that took place at the pubblico passeggio and in churches and theaters to other activities more conducive to moral, intellectual, and psychological development, such as conversing in salons, debating in cafés and other public or semipublic spaces, and reading novels.
MusicBO;120;261;The salient traits that Rossini’s contemporaries perceived in his operas regardless of genre, such as their nonimitative setting of the text, their crucial reliance on repetition, and therefore the looser connection that his operas establish between reality and representation, also recently highlighted by those who have analyzed Rossini’s style, promote these interpretative categories as both historically and analytically grounded.
MusicBO;120;2241;Seen from this viewpoint, the theatricality of Rossini’s operas becomes a response as well as a contribution to the world in which these works were composed and first performed, that is, to an Italian society whose own theatricality was a response to a sense of meaninglessness induced by its traumatic encounter with the turmoil of the Napoleonic years.
MusicBO;120;1707;Thus far I have focused on a number of issues that I believe are central to Rossini’s Italian operas, investigating their discourse in early nineteenth- century Italy and establishing a dialogue between this discourse on one side and, on the other, Rossini’s compositional practices and their dramaturgical outcomes, particularly as analyzed and interpreted in recent musicological research.
MusicBO;120;2460;"Conati has counted a total of 373 opera productions in Italian theaters in the year 1820: 150 were of works by Rossini; 21 by Pietro Generali; 17 by Giovanni Simone Mayr; 15 by Stefano Pavesi; and 13 by Giovanni Pacini, as well as a few others by Carlo Coccia, Luigi Mosca, and the young Saverio Mercadante."
MusicBO;120;3193;The theory of repetition that seems best to illuminate this encounter between its pleasures and a sense of identity predicated on trauma, melancholia, and a radical interrogation of memory is that first advanced by Freud, expanded in subsequent psychoanalytic explorations, and taken up more recently by historians in connection with twentieth- century historical traumas.
MusicBO;120;914;The choice of Milan mitigates somewhat this drawback, given the city’s centrality to the world of Italian opera during this period, and especially the availability of three newspapers that paid significant attention to opera for at least some of these years: the Corriere milanese, the Giornale italiano, and the Corriere delle dame.
MusicBO;120;2282;As a consequence, nobody has linked their theatricality with the theatricality of Italians, generated by their traumatic initial encounter with modernity—a historical and conceptual category that, while remaining profoundly connected to specific historical events, in this context goes beyond any localized and largely untenable separation between the Napoleonic years and the Restoration.
MusicBO;120;1087;Leaving aside the question of intent, two crucial issues are at play here: the first centers on the identity of a piece of music, and the second concerns the tension between individual style and common compositional idiom, or, better, the perceptual and discursive challenges generated by the distinction between the two.
MusicBO;120;2479;If we go back to the data about performances in Milan and Cremona presented earlier, we see that we go back to the data about performances in Milan and Cremona presented earlier confirm the broader perspective, in terms not only of the genres most frequently revived but also of specific operas.
MusicBO;120;4010;But, in a predominantly visual age like ours, when staging has taken on a pivotal dramaturgical function in opera, the primary key to the potential meanings of Rossini’s works today is surely the ways in which they have been visually reimagined for late twentieth- and early twenty- first- century audiences.
MusicBO;120;220;Such contextualizing allows for an interpretation of Rossini’s dramaturgy as a radically new and specifically Italian reaction to the epochmaking changes in all spheres of human activity witnessed in Europe between the late eighteenth and the early nineteenth century, a period usually considered the beginning of modernity proper.
MusicBO;120;2769;While this evidence is circumstantial, a slightly later publication (1874– 75), this time of songs from Piedmont collected by ethnographer Giuseppe Ferraro (a native speaker not only of Italian but also of the regional dialect), includes a text very similar to that from the Veneto region, “Rosina amabili”:
MusicBO;120;3181;In the rest of this chapter and in the following one I attempt to establish a dialogue between the Rossinian discourse and conceptions of modern repetition that seem to address more directly than others the central themes of this discourse as I have explored them in this book.
MusicBO;120;298;I focus on one specific instance of repetition that seems to call for an explanation of this sort: the obsessive return of one basic situation consisting in a prolonged moment of utter confusion, stunned disbelief, complete disorientation on the part of the characters following a traumatic event.
MusicBO;120;938;A revival of Giuseppe Mosca’s Gli amori e l’armi at the Teatro Santa Radegonda in March 1813, for example, received the following, accommodating note: One could call the music a collection of the best pieces that maestro Mosca stole from himself and then assembled in this libretto.
MusicBO;120;2384;The following years saw a consolidation of this phenomenon, with Il barbiere di Siviglia, a relatively late arrival ( June 1816), already established by the end of the decade (1812–21) as the most frequently revived title, together with Tancredi—which, however, had been around longer (since December 1813).
MusicBO;120;2514;"Some famous pieces were disseminated in several different piano- vocal reductions; but equally or perhaps even more important were their instrumental arrangements, not only for solo piano but also for a plethora of other combinations, from solo flute to two guitars, and from string quartet to violin"
MusicBO;120;372;I have consulted a number of the few accessible in print, especially Rossini’s own letters of course, which I have read in detail, but which, unsurprisingly, are mostly silent on the matters explored in Music in the Present Tense—with one notable exception, as we shall see.
MusicBO;120;1608;I have chosen to focus on Il barbiere on account of some recent critical work about it, but also because of its iconic status as the most famous and frequently performed opera by Rossini, one that has long become representative of the composer’s entire comic oeuvre.
MusicBO;120;1407;The trend started very early: according to the critic Friedrich Rochlitz, writing in the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung in 1799, Don Giovanni was the example to follow for German operas in its innovative mixture of comic and serious, since this mixture brought it closer to reality.27
MusicBO;120;1080;According to Guglielmi, then, critics and spectators out to spot presumed instances of plagiarism could not distinguish between the shared compositional language of the time and the salient, identifying traits of a single piece of music, those that should differentiate it from all others.
MusicBO;120;1245;Yet, according to a local journalist, the opera, when it was first performed in Florence in 1818 (one year after its premiere in Milan), was disliked by some of the audience because “music must be suited to the passions that one wants to provoke.
MusicBO;120;1810;In this sense, La gazza ladra became a focal point of this discourse not only because it was an opera semiseria that put on stage the noises of reality with spe Noise 123 cial intensity—including a march to the scaffold accompanied by drums
MusicBO;120;1924;One of the most important consequences of this situation is a new perception of time and space: for Leopardi, it feels as if life is restricted to the present, as if the present is the only temporal dimension available to human subjects.
MusicBO;120;4111;I am thrilled that Music in the Present Tense is the inaugural volume of the new series Opera Lab: Explorations in History, Technology, and Performance, and deeply grateful to its editors, David J. Levin and Mary Ann Smart, for making this possible.
MusicBO;120;1586;Torvaldo e Dorliska was premiered at the Teatro Valle, the other opera house in Rome and rival of the Teatro Argentina (where Il barbiere was first performed), on 26 December 1815, less than two months before the premiere of Il barbiere.
MusicBO;120;1895;I could cite many texts in both verse and prose to pre sent Leopardi’s theories, but I will focus my attention on one that addresses the impact and consequences of modernity head on, the Discorso sopra lo stato presente dei costumi
MusicBO;120;192;My contention, however, is that in Italy these beliefs were inflected in specific and idiosyncratic ways, and that these inflections not only constitute a crucial factor behind the success of his operas but also shape their dramaturgy in fundamental ways.
MusicBO;120;1218;"Besides clarifying the discursive context in which matters of style were debated and explored, Carpani’s text also highlights other aesthetic and dramaturgical issues raised by that discourse; first among them, that of genre, to which the next chapter is devoted."
MusicBO;120;3345;While such a psychoanalytically inspired conclusion goes a considerable way toward constructing an interpretive framework that brings fruitfully together several strands of the early nineteenth- century Italian Rossini discourse, I believe that there is room for further, rather different explorations.
MusicBO;120;1824;It is time, then, to follow the reverberations of Rossini’s mighty sounds out of theaters and into the hearts and minds of his audiences in order to listen more carefully to the noises and silences we might encounter there.
MusicBO;120;4702;This case is different from the other two French operas explicitly based on Italian antecedents, Mosè- Moïse e Maometto II– Le siège de Corinthe, since there the relationship between Italian and French works was explicitly acknowledged by their discourses.
MusicBO;120;785;Nevertheless it is true that, in the historical and geographical context of early nineteenth- century Italy, operatic discourse was based mostly on actual performances and the reading of librettos, with perusal of scores playing a decidedly secondary role.
MusicBO;120;1778;As I have suggested above, this trope did not become common until approximately 1817–18, after a long period of actual wars had come to an end with the Battle of Waterloo and the Congress of Vienna in 1815.
MusicBO;120;2083;"“the presentation to other people of feelings which signify in and of themselves”; in other words, it was not a question of symbols—of expressing outside what is felt inside—but the sharing of signs that made public interaction possible."
MusicBO;120;2092;Sennett’s interpretation of eighteenth- century theatricality pre sents itself mainly as a work of social history, but pre sents itself also echoes some crucial philosophical texts such as the Earl of Shaftesbury’s Characteristiks (1711) and especially Adam Smith
MusicBO;120;2143;The implication is that society had not changed in Italy as much as society had north of the Alps, and thus that Italians had lacked the incentive to develop the tools required to adapt to such changes successfully.
MusicBO;120;2411;The first Rossini opera ever to be performed in Cremona, L’Italiana in Algeri in 1817, was also the first to be revived—which means the first opera ever to be revived in Cremona—two years later and again in 1824.
MusicBO;120;3492;The suspension of temporal sequence achieved by repetition is, paradoxically, a movement that creates a present without past or future: an intervention in sequential time that cuts through this movement to make space for the now, the instant.
MusicBO;120;3883;Another symptom of this historiographical orientation are a number of recent important studies of opera or Italian theatrical music that have managed to circle around Rossini with relative ease while featuring Bellini and his generation much more prominently.33
MusicBO;120;5101;"Here I mention texts that address style directly and go into at least some analytical detail; similar observations are also made in other, more general treatments of Rossini’s dramaturgy, several of which I have mentioned in previous chapters."
MusicBO;120;247;This discourse raises two crucial issues: the identity of a piece of music, and the tension between individual style and common compositional idiom, or, better, the perceptual and discursive challenges thrown up by distinguishing between the two.
MusicBO;120;2508;Ricordi had led the other publishers in this instance as well: in 1812 the firm issued what is, to the best of my knowledge, the first ever piece by Rossini to be printed in Italy, the duet
MusicBO;120;333;I should make clear that I have no desire to obliterate the very different ways in which a canon or a coloratura run signify when compared with a newspaper review of a performance that contains them.
MusicBO;120;846;My impression from reading hundreds of reviews published in several different locations is that initially the topic was raised most often in the local press of those cities with a higher number of Rossini opera performances.
MusicBO;120;1841;The “fatherland,” for Ortis, is the Republic of Venice, and its “sacrifice” its final demise: in 1797 the Treaty of Campoformio between France and Austria that followed the French invasion assigned Venice to the Habsburg Empire.
MusicBO;120;175;One reason for such neglect might have been that the popularity of these operas diminished dramatically during the course of the nineteenth century, and was only partially revived in the second half of the twentieth.
MusicBO;120;397;Occasionally I could not resist pointing the reader to a passage of the Life that seems particularly relevant for the topic being discussed, more often than not because Stendhal explicitly debates Italian opinions or behaviors.
MusicBO;120;425;Yet some critics of such perspectives challenge their application to music history on the grounds that scholars who adopt these interpretive frameworks wind up telling us more about ourselves than about the works being interpreted.
MusicBO;120;1469;I would like to pursue this interpretation, focusing especially on the hints in the libretto that point toward Il barbiere as the staging of an operatic performance, meant to engage its audience in a dialogue.
MusicBO;120;1839;Although the personal and the political are closely intertwined for Ortis and Foscolo alike, Ortis’s identity and his destiny are framed in overtly political terms, as the initial sentences of the novel make clear: “
MusicBO;120;3144;Pound’s slogan is usually taken to refer to modernism proper, the aesthetic movement that, by most accounts, emerged at the end of the nineteenth century and flourished especially in the first half of the twentieth.

MusicBO;120;2128;This hypothesis resonates with a view of early modern Italy as profoundly troubled by its loss of political, economic, and cultural relevance on the world stage—by its irreversible slide from center to periphery.
MusicBO;120;2426;The landscape would be similar in central Italy, especially Tuscany and the central and eastern portions of the Papal States (Umbria and the Marche), while it would look quite different in the South.
MusicBO;120;5958;The case of the Act 1 finale of Il Turco in Italia is partly similar, but Prosdocimo’s music in the slow movement is much closer to what the other characters sing than Figaro’s.

MusicBO;120;315;I read contemporary critical discourse in light of the continuing popularity of a selected number of Rossini’s titles, especially Italian versions of operas originally conceived for Parisian stages between 1826 and 1829.
MusicBO;120;424;Turning to these general theories of the human experience that address directly and fruitfully the specific historical experiences most intimately connected with a particular kind of music should not require further justification.
MusicBO;120;1013;These questions revolve around the crucial issue of style, an issue already emerged implicitly—or explicitly, in the case of Guglielmi’s letter—in several of the many texts I have cited in this chapter.
MusicBO;120;1047;As a result of my own research into this discourse, I now realize that the terms of the question as we tend to treat it today were already in place back then.
MusicBO;120;2063;These tensions are not restricted to recent theoretical elaborations, but span the entire history of the concept of theatricality, even if the term was not explicitly used for most of this history.
MusicBO;120;2340;It is no exaggeration to say that the concept of a modern operatic repertory appeared first in connection with repeated revivals of Rossini’s operas, particularly, if by no means exclusively, in Italy.
MusicBO;120;2944;It occupied a unique space between opera and folk song, since it was literate in origin and its music was systematically written down, but it also circulated orally to a significant extent.
MusicBO;120;4488;2, “Il congegno iterativo e le sue funzioni” (41–78), however, constitutes a valuable analysis of Rossini’s style in terms of the crucial role played by repetition in the construction of single movements.

MusicBO;120;1275;If we turn to a review of its very first performance (La Scala, 31 May 1817) published in the Gazzetta di Milano, we encounter a critique wider than that just discussed.
MusicBO;120;2250;The rhetoric of this text acquires particular resonance when interpreted in the light of the discourse of theatricality explored above: “Which other means are there to make an impact these days?
MusicBO;120;3113;I suggest that this somewhat paradoxical situation is typical of the condition and function of repetition in the context of modernity, at least when it comes to music—as Leopardi had intuited.
MusicBO;120;3389;It is difficult to imagine two philosophers who have influenced music aesthetics in the so- called West over the last two centuries more than Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Arthur Schopenhauer.
MusicBO;120;5691;This volume brings together various collections first published by Ferraro in the 1870s and 1880s: “Rosina amabili” is part of the “Nuova raccolta di canti popolari monferrini,” Rivista europea 5–6 (1874–75).
MusicBO;120;213;I can only hope that this is not the symptom of an obsessive, posttraumatic repetition compulsion—a repetition without difference—but rather a necessary return to the past from a different standpoint.
MusicBO;120;537;These earlier operas were of course those that had contributed most to the general perception that Rossini maintained a cavalier attitude toward the images, emotions, and situations in the libretto.
MusicBO;120;1045;Music was taking a central role in this cultural and ideological process—a role that it has maintained to this day, even if the tones of its rhetoric have changed significantly.
MusicBO;120;1823;What is more, this exploration foregrounds the basic category of sound as a crucial channel through which reality and representation interact, in emotional and psychological as well as mimetic terms.
MusicBO;120;2019;The feelings and emotions characterizing this position or orientation might be described with the terms repeatedly encountered in this chapter: confusion, bewilderment, shock, trauma, impotence, melancholia, self- othering, and indolence.
MusicBO;120;4276;This quote comes from the letter “All’anonimo autore dell’articolo sul Tancredi di Rossini inserito nella Gazzetta di Berlino no. 7, 1818,” first published in 1818 in the journal Biblioteca italiana.
MusicBO;120;540;Whether for or against, everybody seemed to agree that Rossini did something remarkably different not only from these earlier masters but also from many of his more conservative contemporaries.
MusicBO;120;775;I started this chapter by suggesting that one of the factors encouraging analytical investigations on the compositional features of Rossini’s operas has been their increasing availability in critical editions.
MusicBO;120;2104;The most critical moment in the relationship among theater, society, and politics arrived in 1789 with the collective drama of unprecedented proportions and import known as the French Revolution.
MusicBO;120;3601;His mythical paintings, such as Oedipus and the Sphynx (1808), might evoke the sublime, Movement 245 but more on account of their content than because of any formal feature.
MusicBO;120;3872;But of course several Italians had contributed to this history as well, including Niccolò Piccinni, Antonio Sacchini, Giuseppe Sarti, Antonio Salieri, and, more recently, Luigi Cherubini and Gaspare Spontini.
MusicBO;120;3971;Having experienced certain historical events rather than others, especially in one’s youth, became a marker of belonging, binding together people who might otherwise be geographically, socially, and even politically
MusicBO;120;5796;But the context is rather different, relying as the context does essentially on aural memory, without the aid of printed excerpts and the very limited one of manuscript ones.
MusicBO;120;384;The precise compass of this musical memory is difficult to ascertain, but the issue is addressed directly in a number of the texts I consider in chapter 12.
MusicBO;120;628;Rossini’s five early one- act farse, all premiered at Venice’s Teatro San Moisè between 1810 and 1813, are structured according to a single plan repeated almost without alteration.
MusicBO;120;1065;These different strands of evidence suggest that their compositional idioms must have been understood as similar, or at least closer than those of other composers of the period.
MusicBO;120;1103;How to handle a kind of music that seemed to take stylistic individuation to such an extreme that it was impossible to distinguish between different pieces within it?
MusicBO;120;1344;Perhaps the most widely known example of Rossini’s self- borrowing is the insertion into the final duet of Otello of an idea originally found in Don Basilio’s aria
MusicBO;120;1920;Especially revealing is the minimal role played in Italian literature by the novel, the genre through which other nations have confronted and somehow come to terms with modernity.
MusicBO;120;2256;Rossini’s own uniquely theatrical style and dramaturgy were crucially shaped by the psychological and emotional condition of Italians, to which those of spectators and actors contributed in turn.
MusicBO;120;2360;In fact, all Rossini operas performed in Milan in 1815 had already been staged in the city over the course of the previous two and a half years.
MusicBO;120;3672;To begin with, the piece is set up in the preceding recitative as though the piece would be in F minor, but instead it is in F major.
MusicBO;120;3858;In light of the fate of Rossini’s works in Italy after his retirement from operatic composition, both performative and discursive, the older composer’s opinions seem even more ambiguous.
MusicBO;120;233;Many agree that the repetition of a limited number of musical ideas was the most distinctive feature of Rossini’s scores when compared with those of his predecessors.
MusicBO;120;274;I explore the nature and consequences of this trauma through the writings of two uncompromising interpreters of Italy’s first collision with modernity, Ugo Foscolo and Giacomo Leopardi.
MusicBO;120;734;But what if we look at them instead with our feet planted chronologically on the other side of Rossini, at the point Rossini arrived on the scene?
MusicBO;120;982;One must first know the theme and plot of the libretto, and then not be a stranger to musical taste, nor judge precipitously after an initial performance.
MusicBO;120;1614;In Rossini’s case, however, the verbal discourse of metatheatricality in the librettos is thoroughly supported and enhanced by the music, as we have seen in Il barbiere.
MusicBO;120;2409;Let us now look at what happened in a provincial city such as Cremona, historically part of Lombardy and located about one hundred kilometers southeast of Milan.
MusicBO;120;2852;I have countered these statements by observing that Rossini’s melodies are generally both more concise and more clearly articulated than those of his immediate predecessors and contemporaries.
MusicBO;120;3320;Rossini was obviously not the first to depict storms in opera: Gluck and Mozart among others had already done so, notably in Iphigénie en Tauride and Idomeneo.
MusicBO;120;4421;"The first detailed analytical description of the crescendo in Rossini’s operas is found in Gossett, “Le sinfonie di Rossini,” 23–25, 39–40; Gossett, “The Overtures of Rossini,” 10–11."
MusicBO;120;5035;Again, it seems less interesting to decide between the two than to point out how both words and music thematize their opposition, or, perhaps better, their coexistence.
MusicBO;120;5816;A comparison of the two pieces demonstrates that, even if a few melodic ideas (esp. the first one) might be considered similar, their treatment is rather different.

MusicBO;120;188;This study focuses on Rossini’s Italian operas and their discourse in Italy between their first appearance in 1810 and about 1825, when Rossini stopped composing them.
MusicBO;120;195;It is only a slight exaggeration to say that between the early 1810s and the early 1830s Italians moved according to the rhythms of these works—
MusicBO;120;249;How should one handle music that seemed to take stylistic individuation to such an extreme that it was impossible to distinguish between different pieces within it?
MusicBO;120;376;What is more, the vast majority of reviewers appear to have no technical knowledge of music, but were instead littérateurs with an amateur interest in opera.
MusicBO;120;594;In the context of early nineteenth- century Italian operatic discourse, the supposed inability to relate music to text in Rossini’s operas signaled a potential representational impasse.
MusicBO;120;1118;German composers such as Beethoven, and contextualized in terms of the German intellectual tradition represented by such figures as E. T. A. Hoffmann, Goethe, and Friedrich
MusicBO;120;1243;A particularly interesting case of a Rossini opera that came in for sustained criticism in this respect—and at first sight a puzzling one—was La gazza ladra.
MusicBO;120;1872;Italy, however, presented a special situation: unlike Spain, for example, it was not a nation- state but a collection of separate states, some under foreign domination.
MusicBO;120;2285;The first that comes to mind is the genre of mélodrame, probably the most important and certainly the most durable theatrical legacy of the French Revolution.
MusicBO;120;3421;We are well beyond not only Carpani’s aesthetics of pleasure but also the realm of the bello ideale so frequently invoked in Italy at the time.
MusicBO;120;746;What is more, it is likely that Rossini’s impact on this aspect of operatic composition was less keenly felt than in the others discussed above—
MusicBO;120;1314;We are back to the problem that another Milanese journalist had heard in La pietra del paragone, but with a notable difference: whereas Example 5.3
MusicBO;120;2624;This phenomenon goes well beyond the usual parameters, institutions, and locations taken into account when investigating the rise of the repertory in nineteenth- century opera.
MusicBO;120;2859;It seems sensible to turn to other melodies in Tancredi, or its nearcontemporary and, as we have seen, even more successful opera, L’Italiana in Algeri.
MusicBO;120;3055;But it became increasingly so after it began to be repeated, and therefore progressively implanted in the memory of an ever higher number of people.
MusicBO;120;3145;As many have argued, however, modernism is just the most explicit manifestation of an orientation typical of high- cultural production during the last two centuries.
MusicBO;120;3277;Most readers who are familiar with Mozart’s operas, especially the comic ones, will quickly realize the gulf that separates them from Rossini’s in this respect.
MusicBO;120;3298;In fact, acting out is a form of defense against a past that is too traumatic to be contemplated and dealt with directly through memory.

MusicBO;120;504;Second, this text not only discusses Rossini’s operas but also summarizes some of the most prominent themes of the critics who wrote about them.
MusicBO;120;586;In Rossini’s operas, the epitome of modern music, it was quite difficult to understand the words—also on account of the “modern school of singing.

MusicBO;120;1879;These are difficult questions to answer, and thus not surprising that they have been less directly and systematically addressed than their importance might suggest.
MusicBO;120;2126;the distinction between the latter two often more notional than real, if made at all—as somehow quintessential manifestations of the Italian conception of life.
MusicBO;120;2812;On the contrary, they can appear, although not often, in northern Italian folk songs—they do, for example, in the collection featuring the Piedmontese song.
MusicBO;120;2939;Martens’s 1824 testimony is particularly valuable not just for drawing attention to these other famous tunes but also for at least three additional reasons.
MusicBO;120;4542;I will address below the reasons why a supposed self- borrowing by Rossini was discussed in a review of an opera by another composer.
MusicBO;120;191;"Many of these beliefs were shared by the inhabitants of many other European countries, of course; hence the quick spread of Rossini’s success."
MusicBO;120;302;More radically, these operas constituted a form of literal “acting out” and were therefore a symptom of what Freud would have termed “melancholia.
MusicBO;120;551;To this idea Carpani devoted a long appendix to his collection of writings on Rossini, the well- known Le Rossiniane, ossia Lettere musico-
MusicBO;120;629;This arrangement consists of an overture, an introduzione, a duet, an aria, an ensemble, another aria, another duet, another aria, and a finale.
MusicBO;120;647;Conversely, the few studies that do emphasize directly repetition’s crucial role in such practice seem largely uninterested in discussing it in comparative terms.
MusicBO;120;1002;As soon as I heard the main idea of this piece, I thought that Rossini had had a hand in Fingallo e Comala.
MusicBO;120;1519;However, the very first time Rosina actually appears on stage is in the third scene of the opera—a scene set entirely in recitative.
MusicBO;120;1585;An opera semiseria is instead Torvaldo e Dorliska, words by Cesare Sterbini and music by Gioachino Rossini—that is, the authors of Il barbiere.
MusicBO;120;1761;Consequently, I decided to master the roar of the various instruments, and have put them to use to make my music more dramatic.
MusicBO;120;1835;This is not an entirely original text, but rather a riff on one of Blaise Pascal’s Pensées, which Fo scolo knew and loved.2
MusicBO;120;1892;The nature and consequences of this trauma are single- mindedly explored in the writings of the most astute and uncompromising interpreter of Italy
MusicBO;120;2020;I want to emphasize that I am not saying that all middle- and upper- class Italians were traumatized by the arrival of modernity.
MusicBO;120;2168;I am rather referring to discursive formations generated by a process of internalizing representations staged in the mirror of an external, dominating gaze.
MusicBO;120;3128;According to this discourse, the composer’s music provided a previously unknown kind of pleasure, both in its intensity and its physical, bodily dimension.
MusicBO;120;3210;By the fascinated faces of one and the other, one can see the turmoil in their minds, which waver and doubt, remaining uncertain.
MusicBO;120;3384;Furthermore, some of these 232 Chapter Fourteen images suggest a transfer of energy that generates movement—for example, electricity, delirium, and even, metaphorically, seduction.
MusicBO;120;3635;Is there something specific in the music of this trio that may have caused such intense yet potentially contradictory reactions in our critic?

MusicBO;120;510;In fact, they will act as the backbone for my overall investigation into the Rossinian discourse in early nineteenth- century Italy.

MusicBO;120;648;Most prominent among them are perhaps those on the crescendo, considered the hallmark of Rossini’s style by his contemporaries.
MusicBO;120;882;For now I want to focus on another reason why it is worth discussing the case of Il Turco.
MusicBO;120;883;When calling attention to self- borrowing, both reviews explicitly invoke the authority of at least part of the audience.
MusicBO;120;1468;In any case, both scholars emphasize the metatheatrical dimension of the opera, whether scripted by Figaro or the Count.
MusicBO;120;1593;Taken together, several others support the suggestion that a metatheatrical dimension is central to the dramaturgy of Il barbiere.
MusicBO;120;1699;Rossini’s practice, then, concurs with the contemporary Italian discourse, which did not differentiate between genres when addressing self- borrowing.
MusicBO;120;1876;How did it affect their conception of this extraordinary new world in which the Italian people found themselves immersed?

MusicBO;120;227;If Rossini’s music did not attempt to represent the emotions depicted by the words, what was its function?
MusicBO;120;276;One of the consequences of this loss was the sense that one’s life was restricted to the present.
MusicBO;120;340;I engage with some of these debates in the chapter on theatricality, to which they are particularly relevant.
MusicBO;120;624;The idea of repetition has rarely been invoked explicitly in discussions of Rossini’s practice at larger formal levels.
MusicBO;120;1113;The decades around 1800 were a crucial period in the history of the concept of style in music.

MusicBO;120;1449;Common to several of these interpretations is the concept of metatheatricality, even if this term seldom appears explicitly.
MusicBO;120;1594;This dimension emerges even more clearly in Act 2 of the opera, especially in the singing lesson scene.
MusicBO;120;1815;I would not want to suggest that no differences exist between the reality of war and its discourse.
MusicBO;120;2103;Thus, we suppress our natural feelings as we are forced to socialize and end up isolating ourselves instead.
MusicBO;120;2169;In this sense the discourse of noise explored previously can be integrated in the broader discourse of theatricality.

MusicBO;120;2564;These different objects point toward different typologies of consumption in different circumstances and settings, and for different purposes.
MusicBO;120;2896;You only have to compare any German folk song with a Venetian one to have this claim confirmed.
MusicBO;120;3085;But the same was true of many other writers of the period who are not usually labeled Romantics.

MusicBO;120;937;In general, accusations of plagiarism were formulated in more sharply censorious tones than those of self- borrowing.
MusicBO;120;1041;Still, there is no denying that Rossini’s self- borrowing sits uneasily in the rhetoric of originality (
MusicBO;120;1097;I would argue that the new stylistic traits displayed by Rossini’s operas wrong- footed traditional listening habits.

MusicBO;120;2243;Rossini’s dramaturgy, both comic and serious, was characterized by distance, objectivization, and selfreferentiality
MusicBO;120;2333;The reasons why repertory is crucial to a study of the early nineteenthcentury
MusicBO;120;2474;These data point to a vast gap between Rossini and all other composers.

MusicBO;120;3342;In fact, this music is pleasurable precisely because this music prevents rational thought.

MusicBO;120;827;We have an example of a different kind of repetition . .
MusicBO;120;997;Indeed, Rossini and Pavesi were explicitly coupled as inveterate (self- ) borrowers.
MusicBO;120;1148;the word “librettist,” originally derogatory, began to substitute for the eighteenth- century
MusicBO;120;1409;This maneuver emerges most obviously in the debate about its generic definition.
MusicBO;120;1450;According to Paolo Gallarati, for example, the characters in L’Italiana in Algeri,
MusicBO;120;1507;In both cases Rosina takes on the melody initially presented by Lindoro.
MusicBO;120;1692;In both, Rossini tends to turn to recent works for his borrowing.
MusicBO;120;1812;but also because it did so soon after the Congress of Vienna.
MusicBO;120;2131;But which kind of theatricality is implied by this brief historical sketch?
MusicBO;120;2576;Perhaps it was so obvious that it need not even be mentioned.
MusicBO;120;2675;Here is the text of “Di tanti palpiti” by librettist Gaetano Rossi:

MusicBO;121;875;It is certainly possible to discern some stylistic focal points in the collection, but in its broadest outlines, the collection evinces a pattern of consumption that reflects what seems to have been available for purchase.
MusicBO;121;1788;we can see that the final shipment of the 'sortimento' did not include all the partbooks of XVIIIb, but only 57 of 86, for a total of 15 of the 22 editions inventoried by Chiti.

MusicBO;121;1411;all of these editions issued from presses in Naples: Ottavio Beltrano (the archiépiscopal printer), Giovanni Giacomo Carlino (Gesualdo's personal printer and another archiépiscopal printer), Giovanni Battista Gargano Lucrezio Nucci and Costantino Vitale.

MusicBO;121;621;In addition to the constant expansion of his collection, many books came into Martini's hands as loans so that he could have them copied and/or record them in his bibliography.
MusicBO;121;1122;Most of the tract volumes described by Chiti are included in Sard's catalogue under the name of the first composer represented in each volume or under the heading 'Autori diversi'.

MusicBO;121;3011;Not in Chiti's inventory, but definitely belonging to this volume, since the manuscript numbering, different for each partbook and in the same hand, matches that of the previous print exactly.

MusicBO;121;515;Richard Agee also provides notes on the provenance of Gardano prints in Martini's collection, including those inventoried by Chiti (with references to Parisini, Carteggio inedito del P. Giambattista Martini).
MusicBO;121;557;Another music theory catalogue, probably earlier, can be found in the manuscript I-Bc 1.47.2, significant for its size (containing around 450 titles), for its inclusion of printed books, and
MusicBO;121;1225;In this case, Gaspari exchanged the Liceo's incomplete copy for the complete copy at the basilica of San Petronio, where Gaspari worked as maestro di cappella beginning in 1857.

MusicBO;130;559;Rhythm, phrasing, and articulation are handled by Martini in an essentially cursive Baroque manner, though not without some of the inevitable conflicts of a transitional style.

MusicBO;132;443;Under Colonna the size of the regular orchestra was not altered significantly, so that when Torelli was hired to play viola in September of 1686 Giuseppe Torelli became one of only eleven regularly employed instrumentalists.
MusicBO;132;445;Although Perti himself was an active composer of instrumental music, the orchestra at San Petronio was soon disbanded, primarily because Pope Innocent xii's economic reforms would not permit the expenses of a professional resident orchestra.
MusicBO;132;66;This illustrated monograph combines a study of the unique architecture of San Petronio and the musical implications of its design with an examination of church records, musical manuscripts, pictorial documents, and antique musical instruments.
MusicBO;132;158;An examination of surviving instruments that were used elsewhere in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, however, will offer an insight into the general musical properties of the instruments in the San Petronio orchestra.
MusicBO;132;647;Appendix A Catalogue of Manuscripts at San Petronio, the Sources of Torelli's Festival Compositions with Trumpet Of the impressive list of composers employed in the orchestra at San Petronio during the Baroque era
MusicBO;132;8;The collection of musical manuscripts still preserved in the church archives is perhaps the richest treasure of evidence central to the style of instrumental music played by the orchestra at San Petronio.
MusicBO;132;396;The Size of the Orchestra One of the most significant events in the history of Bolognese instrumental music was the hiring of Maurizio Cazzati in 1657 as chapel master at San Petronio.
MusicBO;132;482;Another method of inferring the size of the orchestra used for special occasions at San Petronio is to examine the manuscript parts of certain large-scale works written for performance in the church.
MusicBO;132;150;Behind this rear section was a large platform, which was raised slightly above the level of the rest of the cantoria, filling the entire south end of the apse.
MusicBO;132;57;In Venice, the late operas of Claudio Monteverdi stimulated a rush of operatic composition and performance that attracted international attention to such composers as Cavalli, Cesti, and Legrenzi.
MusicBO;132;412;Although Colonna himself wrote no purely instrumental music,̂ his fine orchestra attracted a large number of outstanding performers, who also composed instrumental music for use in the church.^^
MusicBO;132;480;This money was used for such items as wine, the construction of decorations, the transportation of two extra positive organs into the cantoria,®^ and the payment of musicians.
MusicBO;132;614;Figure 30 is a possible graphic representation of Perti's chart with the violins and violas on opposite sides of the cantoria and the continuo instruments at the rear.
MusicBO;132;698;The instrumentation of the score is duplicated in the parts for Tromba I and Tromba II and Oboe I and Oboe II, which were transcribed by a copyist.
MusicBO;132;231;It is possible that this term was intended to specify either a contrabass gamba or a contrabass violin, the same two possibilities as for the term violone.
MusicBO;132;314;The cornetto was used regularly at San Petronio throughout most of the seventeenth century, and continued to be used, though less regularly, into the early eighteenth century.
MusicBO;132;703;The first movement of D.V1I.4 (Table B) is an altered version of the first movement of the second concerto of Torelli's Opus 5, published in 1692.
MusicBO;132;470;Although the regular orchestra was of a modest size, the number of permanent employees was greatly augmented for musical events on special feast days.
MusicBO;132;595;The instrumentalists seem to be grouped at the rear of the cantoria with theorbo players next to the two large columns at either end.
MusicBO;132;685;For example, only one trumpet is specified in the autograph score of D.VI.7 (Table A) , although there is a separate autograph part for
MusicBO;132;711;Moreover, the first movement of D.VIII.5 duplicates the second movement of Perti's Sinfonia avanti La Messa a 8 Concta (P. 1.1. in the archive).
MusicBO;132;121;̂ The final vaulting of the central nave was begun in 1589 by Terribilia, who died in 1604 without finishing the project.
MusicBO;132;129;One of the greatest shortcomings of the earlier cappella was the lack of space for musicians, especially during the major liturgical feasts.
MusicBO;132;160;The master-craftsmen of the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries built violins that differed in several respects from those played in concerts today.
MusicBO;132;224;"In 1738 Johann Philippe Eisel reported that the term ""violone"" referred to any one of three different instruments: a contrabass gamba tuned:"
MusicBO;132;238;Three treble wind instruments appear with some regularity in the festival orchestras at San Petronio: the trumpet, the oboe, and the cornetto.
MusicBO;132;701;Several movements of the manuscript compositions are not unique, but are used in other works of Torelli and his teacher, Giacomo Perti.
MusicBO;132;1561;Sergio Paganelli is preparing a detailed study of the several copyists of music active at San Petronio during the time of Torelli.
MusicBO;132;298;His name appears regularly between 1680 and 1699 on the lists of musicians hired for the annual feast of Saint Petronius.
MusicBO;132;464;Instead, the musicians who had been scattered throughout Europe disseminated and even increased the reputation of the instrumental music at Bologna.
MusicBO;132;1539;The orchestra boasted such composers as Giovanni Maria Bononcini (1624—1648), Giovanni Bononcini (1670—1755), Giovanni Battista Vitali (1644-1692), Tommaso Antonio Vitali (ca.
MusicBO;132;334;"this designation is also possible that the designation is derived from the French word ""buisine"" and therefore specifies a trombone."
MusicBO;132;1559;"Since Torelli's autograph manuscripts exhibit two different musical hands, a distinction has been made between ""Autograph I"" and ""Autograph II."
MusicBO;132;395;Certain elements indicate a pitch close to the present, although other elements suggest a pitch about a semitone higher.^^
MusicBO;132;1517;This information was confirmed by Luigi Ferdinando Tagliavini in a conversation with the author on 21 May 1969. ^^
MusicBO;132;302;Three virtuoso oboists who were employed occasionally at San Petronio were Ludovico Ertman, Pompeo Pierni,*^ and Pietro Bettinozzi.^
MusicBO;132;409;Cazzati recommended that Cazzati be replaced by Giovanni Legrenzi, the brilliant Venetian composer of instrumental music and operas.
